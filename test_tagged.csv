They, always have the on other objects for what they suposably didn't do. In a couple people can go anywhere and reaseach everything. Poeple who stay at a computer @NUM1 hours a day are making discison. Its not like a computer tell you not to do something people beleive that technology as a person into doing things. Well their wrong. Its the person who is letting technology take control. Because if they wanted to they could possibly stop and go out side for a walk or run.

8887,1,"I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They help you stay in touch with family in a couple different ways they excercise your mind and hands and help you learn and make things easier. Computer's help you keep in touch with people. Say you live in @LOCATION1 and you miss your @CAPS1. You can just send an e-mail and talk all you want. If you don't just want to limit it to words you can add pictures so they can see how much you've grown or if you are well. Even if you're just e-mailing someone down the block it is just as effective as getting up and walking over there. You can also use a computer to make a scrap book card or slide show to show how much you love the person you give them to. Computers @MONTH1 not excercise you whole body but it excersises you mind and hands. You could play solitaire on the computer and come away @PERCENT1 smarter than before. You can play other games of strategy like checkers and chess while still sitting at home being comfortable. Your hands always play a big role while you're on the computer. They need to move the mouse and press the keys on a keyboard. Your hands learn all the keys from memorization. It's like the computer's teaching handi-coordination and studying habit for the future. Computers make human lives easier. Not only do they help kids turn in a nice neatly printed piece or paper for home work but they also help the average person. Teachers use it to keep peoples grades in order and others use it to write reports for various jobs. The @CAPS2 probably uses one to write a speech or to just keep his day in order. Computers make it easier to learn certain topics like the @LOCATION2 history. You can type something into a searcher site and have ton's of websites for one person with, who knows how much imformation. Instead of flipping through all the pages in a dictionary you can look for an online dictionary, type in the word and you have the definition.

I however believe that computers are amazing things that make life not only easier, but more enjoyable as well. Computers teach hand-eye coordination which is available through sports as well, but much easier for the unathletic through computers. Not only do computer give us skills but they allow us to learn of the people nd places to us. Yet computers are not so along with getting information on far away people and places you can actualy talk to a person from anywhere around the world! In our local comunity only about @NUM1 of the population are at and capable of truly hand -eye coordination through sports. This is where computers are useful. They can teach hand-eye coordination to anyone. This skill is taough by a hand- held controler called a mouse that once moved will also move a person or the computer screen. This is a vere effective techmique that is even useful with special people. Computers give us access to pictures and information on far away people or places. This is a very useful thing, since @CAPS3 allows you, our local paper, accurete news ion both distant and local events. @CAPS3 is also proven that students have a better on of a place if they can see @CAPS3. If by a terrible chance computers were removed from our society, our students would reserve lower scores on world geography quizzes or even tests. By such a reasoning taking away computers taking our knowledge on places. Computers not only help to give us a better understandings on foreighn places, but they also allow us a one on one @CAPS5 with people of such places.

Computers also to news, for example if a family member was about to one could just get on the computer and a culture. If one were to a letter saying by the they got there @CAPS3 could be too late. And thus I implore you, our local paper, to support our fight to keep computers.

Not only do computers teach this hands skill but they allow for us to learn of faraway places without actually going to that place and they allow is to talk and intersit with our friends, family and even! Computers are incredible in that they give us the chance to learn of a place where we can not go. Since the creation at the internet, studies have proven that our country's overall average intelect has increased by over @PERCENT1! @PERSON2 has a remark a this subject."" I am astranded that such a simple idea has turned out to be the largest virtual library has ever known!"" I could not help but to agree with him. Many people have learned of faraway places, reachable and unnexchable, in amazing detail just by viewing articals that the internet and computers offer. I have to admit that you have to sit down and read @CAPS2 which doesn't benefit you physically but it majorly benefits you mentally in a very minimum amount at time. Hand eye coordination is one of the most underectinated skills that computers provide. Technology is only going to advance, so why not get i over with and adapt to the new ways that things are being done by? Hand eye coordination is an essential skill in the jobs we have @DATE1. Someone who has expirienced hand eye coordination would tell you that the practice and the was with it because they can get papers and projects done faster, and more efficiently. A fast typer can make as much as @MONEY1 an hour when they first set hired! Only computers teach this skill and it is almost imposible to learn this skill from something else. A new advancement in technology allows as to interact with one friends, family, and over forieners! Besides the cheap monthly cost of the internet, most of @CAPS2 services are completely free! Instead of wasting minutes on your exposive cellular phone, you can just chat with your friends and family online for free. @CAPS2 free social services can even connect you with people in different countries, so you can learn about their lifestyle and culture as I did! @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS2 advancements are remarkable and everybody should take advantage of @CAPS2 services."" I hope what I've said has an impact on you. Like I said before technology is only going to advance, so be love to adopt to it.

8891,1,"Dear Local newspaper, I think that people have lately spent too much time on their computers. People who have been doing so are increasing the percentage of obecity. The reason I am writing this to you is because the percentage of obecity is currently increasing, people are spending less time exercising and spending less time interacting with others. First, the percentage of obecity is increasing. The reason is that people just stay indoors, they never feel the need to be fit. This is also risking their lives, all they do is just sit and eat. This could risk the chances of getting deceases. For example, lets say a person spends nearly @NUM1 hrs a day on the computer. This person ate salty foods which risked high cholesterol. While this person was using the computer this person had a heart attack. Second, the people who use the computer are not exercising. These people need to exercise, its good for them, it helps them avoid having to take trips to the hospital, by that I mean not getting heart attacks. It is important to at least exercise for @NUM2 hrs. a day. Do something like take a walk in the park, go hiking, ride a bike, do push ups. There's all kinds of things you could do. For example, there was once a man that all he did was use the computer, he once used to be athletic until his mother gave him a computer. After that he only used the computer, he never exercised nor comunicated with his friends. That was until his friends told him that he was too addicted to that machine. So his friends helped him get back on his feet. Finally, people don't interact with their own friends and family. This is the biggest thing that you should be concerned because with computers people don't interact with themselves and @MONTH1 cause relationships to get ruined. The difference between the average man and the man that uses computers is that the average man actually has a job and has to support his family, while the man that uses computers all he actually does is play games or use the social networks to communicate with strangers. In conclusion, you should be concerned about people's use of computers. It increases obecity. It decreases the interaction with others and you'll spend less time exercising and more time on the computer.

8895,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I do not believe that computers are helping today's society. I feel computers are making our situation here in @LOCATION1 worse. Now a day's you see less people in parks playing catch or teenagers signing up for there local sports team, because they're too busy signing up for a ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4"" acount. People are for example when I went to work with my aunt I saw so many adults on their laptos during there lunch brake, instead of enjoying their limited time off to relaxe and get out of the office.

8892,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is in my firm belief that to many people spend far too much time on their computers these days. Computers can be a very useful tool, but they can also be very harmful. I think that being on a computer consistently (day after day), degrades a person's communication skills, @CAPS2 lowers the exercise they get which hurts their healthy, but if a person manages to balance this time equally betwenn being on a computer and everything else in life then you will succed. Although computers are very valuable resources, spending too much time on them could hurt a person's communication skills. For example, if you sit on your butt all day in front of a computer you won't have any interaction with the outside world. So the next time you actually talk (and not just e-mail or text) someone, you will flounds. You won't know what to say or how to act because you haven't done @CAPS2 for so long. Now I understand that in some jobs you have to work on a computer all day. That's fine @CAPS2's just when you do @CAPS2 nepeditivley that @CAPS2 starts to harm you. You won't be able to laugh and joke around with your friends the way you used to because you'll be spending the whole time thinking about what to say next. Typing to your friends on your computer is much different than actually greating to them in person. These reasons are why I seriously believe that spending time on a computer will will your communication skills. No matter the you are on the computer. Besides hurting your communication skills. Spending too much time on the computer gives you no. Having no exercise is very unhealthy and can lead people to becoming obese. Another harmfull is sitting around all day, only exercising your fingers can lead to arthritis which is becoming a bigger problems in young people not only can you get arthritis, but there are many more dangerous symtoms of having on your computer for too long. The main problem is in the lack of of health that you develop and we all know how important our health is. @CAPS2 can affect our progress how we and just lives in general. So spending to much time on a computer is a serious health issue because of the lack of exercise that you receive. Though not all is bad with the computer. @CAPS2 seem very valuable tool and is a great source of knowledge. Only be our time equally between the time we spend on the computer and the time we give to everything else in the world. Do we achieve. For instance maybe you want to look up the symtons of mans. Okay spend about an hour on the computer in searching and then go out side and play with your dog in the bright @DATE1 day. You could even combine your time on the computer with a friend. Play a video game together joke and laugh. So computers are in great thing, but we must be able to balance our time on them and on everything around us. In conclusion I say again that a computer is a great tool, only when @CAPS2 is not abused. People cannot spend too much time on the computer because @CAPS2 degrades their communication skills and ruins their health because @CAPS2 allows no exercise, however when we balance our time between the computer and everything else we got the best of both world message.",,,,3211,31,594,844,19.1612903226,586,3.62,1,223,1,149,93,34,54,20,83,1,0,0,0,0

8902,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on the effect of computers is that they dominate us, and we end up spending far too much time in their grasp. Rather than checking the lates + fashions, or learning that your friend is going to sleep, we should be being productive. We should be doing more useful things with our time, like exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with our family and friends. Rather than spending all of our time frivolously fooling around on a computer, we should and ought to be exercising. @PERCENT1 of our population is overweight, so we really need to get out and exercise. America @MONTH1 be one of the larger powers in the world, but we have far too many pudgy people. And people who get that way normally do not stop. This leads to overall sloth fullness. The computers is the source of this problem. All of the nature in our world is going fast. The trees are getting hacked down and not replaced. Acid rain from pollution is tearing down acres and acres of dells and hollows full of trees. The habitats being destroyed also lead to the threatening and eventual extinction of many species of animals. So we must go out and see the world, enjoy it, before it is torn to pieces. But we can't because we are far too busy checking the lates @CAPS3 updates. I remember many times asking friends to hang out, but they couldn't because they were too busy on the computer. We must spend time with our family and friends! If we don't people, being people, will have all their feelings bottled up, and than explode on someone because of their choice to be a hermit up, locked in their room on the computer. Though people @MONTH1 argue against its talking on facebook, or emailiing is not communicating. It is just being too lazy to actually be with friends and family. We need to see each other, hold friendships. It is very important for our sanity and well-being. Computers are the source of laziness, and just a temporary way to forget the world. We should be exercising, which would do us a lot of good in an overweight country, enjoying nature before it disappears on as completely, and spending time with the people we love and care about.

Well, the answer to that questions is @CAPS9 because they teach hand eye coordination, has the ability to learn about all the other things you cant learn about in your area, and it has the ability to talk to others from there computers/laptops.

It's good to keep in touch and all but, maybe people should see those people and talk to them in person. @PERCENT1 of people would rather talk to friends in person than though video chat on a computer.

8907,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2! My name is @PERSON1, and I've been noticing how computers are becoming more of a popular topic. Some people say they think computers are unecessary, while others dissagree. My standpoint on this subject is more of a supporting than dissagreeing, mainly because it allows you to obtain info in a snap, it allows you to talk to people easily, and it can advance our technology further. First of all, computers are like a huge filling cabinet filled with information, weather it be on the first @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5, or a basket ball game that was on @TIME1. With the click of a mouse, you can find almost anything in the world, even as its happening! Computers are such a good resource, that if you are wondering something and you just can't figure out the answer, just hop on the computer and poof! You have what you're looking for in two-tenths of a second! I truly believe computers are awesome information finders. To continue, computers also have the ability to allow you and a friend to talk to each other. Weather you prefer @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on, there are always many options to chatting it up with a friend, far-away family member, or, anyone, really! Communication is key. You can have a conversation with someone without having to say a word! If someone is near a computer, like, they have a laptop, but their cellphone died and there arent any phones around, they could send an @CAPS10 or @CAPS11-mail and ask for help from a friend or family member. Overall, computers are a great alternative for communication. Lastly, computers have a very important and useful ability, they can advance us further into technologie's future. just imagine a world where computers are ten times faster than they are now, and everyone has video chat. They would all receive updates from around the world, and know almost everything thats going on! Our society would benefit from these improvements by so much. This is why I believe computers can easily advance us greatly in technology. To wrap up, I believe computers are necessary in daily life. They allow us to obtain information, talk to people, and advance ourselves further. I hope you agree with me and spread the word about computers. Thank you for your time.",,,,2263,24,393,609,16.375,384,2.45,1,212,2,109,72,22,29,18,46,0,0,0,0,1
8908,1,"Dear Newspaper, I do believe computers are better for society for various reasons; going green. Contacting friends/family and also, @CAPS1 around the world. There are pros & cons about computers but, they mainly are for the best. First going green is a big problem in our society because many people don't recycle. If we all use computers there wont be a reason for us to use paper and need to recycle. Everything we will need we can get of the computer. For example teachers print there work off a computer so why print it if we can all use computers. Yes, many people don't get alot of excerise but, we can fix that & have a solution. Going green & doing everything on computers would & will help the world/earth a lot. Another reason for using computers is because many of us have family out of country or state & not always can we get to a phone. Using a computer will make everything quicker. For example, you pay internet once a month & you can do whatever you want on it & stay however long on it. But if you call you need to buy a calling card &/or you have limited time it will cost more. Mailing letters take too long & won't get there for a while. Computers is a right there, fast & quick. Finally my third & final reason is @CAPS1, yes there are predators on computers but they're going to be everywhere, so you can't let them stop you from doing what you have to do. Sometimes, television & Newspaper dont cost or print out information quick enough or correctly. Or just print & cast whats around them. Maybe your not from here & something happens to your country & you want to cnow what happens you can go online & figure it out quickly. Even though the internet/computers has it bads, it also has its positives so, yes get out & play, enjoy nature. But at the same time take advantage of what you got. There are just some reasons why i believe computers are good for society.",,,,1890,22,361,517,16.4090909091,352,2.45,1,169,0,81,74,18,32,28,35,1,0,1,0,0
8909,1,"The effects that computers have an people are good. They allow us to learn about faraway places, allow us to talk with other people and they teach people how to do thins. The computer allows us to talk with others. Some families have relatives in far away places. This makes it hard fo then to keep in touch with each other. Thanks to the computer they can easily e-mail or video chat to get the latest on what is happening or just even to say, ""@CAPS1"". The computer also allow for buisness meetings. If a mom or dad has a child at home, they can't go into work. They can still attend meetings by going on the computes though. All they have to do is get a web can and they can be as active participator at the office from home. Another task that one could complete on the computer is the organize events. One year I had a birthday party and didn't feel like writing invatations. I sent a e-mail to my friends and all of the @CAPS2.S.V.P'd from the computer. Without the computer, many people couldn't communicate with others. The ocmputers allow us to learn about faraway places. Many people chose vacations on the internet. People are able to access the internet and search fun locations in, say, @LOCATION1. They would find that these are many amusement parks and restaurants in @LOCATION1. If that's what they are looking for, then the family would go to . The computer also allows us to see foutage of places we haven't seen. Say your from @LOCATION3 and you really want to se the inaguration of @LOCATION4 in @LOCATION2. That isn't a problem. Sites like @ORGANIZATION1 would bring you live coverage from your computer. Computer also allow people to fly to far away places. The navigation system and many electornics on the plane are made with computers. Without a navigation system, planes wouldn't be able to fly far distances. Computers do a lot to help people learn of far away places. Computers help us learn things. Some colleges have online courses to teach students. A new survey shows that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 college degrees come from online schools. Computers help us build things. This year in @CAPS3. class we built a bird house. I got my design off on internet site which largly helped me build the bird house. Computers also help us coule. These are many sites which have great recipes for cookies, pasta or any kind of food you can think of. Computers are benifiting to society.

8906,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 is obvious or should be obvious to everyone that computers have mainly had a positive effect on everyone. There are some that argue about how computers have made things worse but in reality our world has just improved with this highly sophisticated manor. If  our people of @LOCATION1 didn't have our computers we would all be lost. Computers are spontaneously fascinating because they keep people learning about what's going on in the rest of the world, they let people communicate in a matter of seconds, and they help people learn about anything they want. The first detail of why computers have benefited us so well is how @CAPS1 helps us learning about the world. Whenever you go on website there is probably and telling you something that's happening in another country. Without computers people would never know of the starvation of the people of @LOCATION2. If you go to any news website the homepage usually tells you a lot about something important happening in the world right now. Even after these facts people still say you can just read a newspaper. This is very false however. If you are reading the news and something big happens the news can't change. If you read newspaper online however, the sites are constantly edited keeping you exactly up to time on what's going on, without computers our country would sound ignorant and foolish for we woudn't have an idea of what's going on in the world. The continuing detail on why computers are intriguingly important is because people can communicate with a chatter in a matter of seconds. If you need to ask something to someone you can just send them message and they get back to you very quickly. People will say @CAPS2 can do these things but they can't do one thing a computer can do and that's webcam. With a webcam you can contact a person and talk them like you're with them. You can even see them on your computer screen. This is great for friends that move away or parents that are on work trips. You just click on the webcam button and the person you want to webcam with and you can see them without even being near them. Computers bring communication to a whole new level and without @CAPS1 we'd be out of date and lost. The last reason computers have done only goods is that @CAPS1 helps people learn of whatever they'd like. If you need to learn about something for a project instead of searching through a book store or library or a book store you just search up wahat you need and find @CAPS1 out. You can type whatever you want to learn about into a computer and learn all about the subject in an hour. Computers have made our society more intelligent and that will help us in the long run to keep our human race alive. We maybe people who rely on technology but in our generation @CAPS1 is only making us smarter with all of its computer search engines. After the facts that have been presented here @CAPS1's plain to see that computer have done so much good for custle bad just fades a way. These ingenius devices keeps us informed of the worlds problems, let people communicate in a matter of seconds, and they let people learn of whatever they want very quickly.

If your a new mommy to be and curious to know what to do, or how to do @CAPS2, @CAPS3 type in the site and @CAPS2'll have instructions and images showing you and telling you.

8910,1,"Dear @CAPS1 editor, I think computers are a great help and advansement for our comunity. Computers allow you to get information on a report topic without having to drive to a library to check a book out. What if your relitive was in @LOCATION1 and your in @CAPS2 the only way to see and talk to them is by a computers webcam. Also if computers are used for hand-eye coordination, then you can do beter in sports like baseball which requires good hand-eye coordination. If your relitive is far away you could chat to them over the internet. Many people @MONTH1 think you could do this over the phone, but the computer actually lets you see the people and chat to them. So if you need to be at an important work confrence far away and you can't get there then you could use a webcam on the computer and talk to the people with out being there. All intelligent people know how great of an advansement a computer is for talking to people all over the country and world. So consider this idea as good uses for computers. What if you had a report and your library only had a couple books on that topic, what do you do now? Isn't it easier to just surch up the topic and have hundreds of resources to use? Well a computer can do that. All you have to do is go to a phrase in and you've got hundreds of resorces at your finger ties. So what is easier surchinh in a library or to the inter net were everything is at your figer tips. I think you'll all agree with me that a computer is easier and fastre. You know that most sports require good hand-eye coordination right. How would you feel if you couldn't do good in a sport because of bad hand-eye coordination. Well the computer could be used as hand-eye coordination in hansen. Play some games on the computer and you'll start to develope good hand-eye coordination. You'll be more active, because you feel confidnet you can do good in sport, now. So the computers can help people be active. you could even become the star player if you work hard enough. The time is now, I want you to print an article saying how imoportant coputers are to us. I mean computers help you with reports, you can talk far away relitives, even hand-eye coordination.

More than @PERCENT1 of kids from @NUM1 still have difficulties typing. So computer programs that teach students how to type should be required in school acidemic programs.

8916,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think's computers are a bad influences on people. They will take away things that people need should enjoy. Like exensing, going at havig fun, or family time. Hear me out on what I have to say. First, computes will be bad because people will spend less time execising. People wat to get fit, but with all those distractions like facebook, @CAPS2 one all those things. It is very hard for people to pull away so they can exercise. when people can't exercise they can have in their body. Doctors probably wont want unhealthy people who in their operating room. Also when people get unhealthy they tend to get a little fat. When they a little fat people sometimes lose confidence or motivation. Then they dont do anything one thats right back to writing. Next, people wont get to see whats really all there in nature. Getting fresh air and sunlight the bay is a great idea, computers are a great distraction. There is so many other things to that do. People comp while they fish and hunt. For those wo can't to camp there is always skiing or snowboarding. In to @DATE1 ther swimming and other sports too. There so @MONTH1 other things that people could be doing. Instead of the computers, out of all those things, all of them go fun and who doesn't like fun. Finally, computer takes time away from family. Families are spending to much time on the computer with eachother. Families want stay with each other good way is to spend time with parents. Without communicating or bonding bad things can enter a kids life. Like drugs and smoking. Familes will have a much higher chance of this hot happening if they just spent time and bondded together so that way they can talk to their kids. Also a result in bonding with parents and the child is teenagehood. As in the child will the resent the parents more. This over the top, and stressing them and causing big fights or breaking. So if the kids got off the computer and with the family or went out did somethig together it would be less likely the kid will get in trouble with drugs parents wont have to be stressed out, and hate their kid all the way through teenagehood. In conclusion, computers are bad. They stop people from becoming healthy, takes away the great outdoors and has the potential to tear a family apart. So stay away computers as soon as possible so you can enjoy the many other things @CAPS3 has given us to enjoy.",,,,2404,33,439,617,13.303030303,426,1.28,1,208,0,107,84,35,34,19,49,0,0,0,0,0

My sister is always on the computer constantly and I @DR1 it can get annoying because she never wants to do anything else. Also sitting on the computer all day isn't good for your body.

I noticed that as my friend @PERSON1 began to spend more time on the computer he started to go less with his friends and family. That is only one of the powerful effects computers have on you. It's like they're taking over your mind and not letting you do anything elese. They also stop you from spending the time you should be spending with your family. Every one knows spending some time with the family is always entertaining. Going on computers can also be dangerous. Kids can being doing things you're not aware about.

8917,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 newspaper, I believe computers have positive effects on society. Computers benefit us by facilitating research, connecting friends and loved ones around the world, and they can even help make disabled peoples' lives easier. If used properly, computers enhance our day-to-day lives and prove to be a valuable resource and knowledge base. Have you ever had to find an answer to a question on the computer? Well, in order to do so, you simply must open @CAPS3 @CAPS4, log into a search engine, and type your question. However, to find an answer to a question without using a computer is a long and tedious process. First, you must drive to your local library, which is about @NUM1 minutes away for most @LOCATION1 citizens. Then, you must search to find a parking space, dig around in your wallet to find your library card, then trudge inside. Once in the library, you must laboriously pour over card catalogs, find your book, and search the index. ""I really love using the computer for research. @CAPS7 makes finding information fun and easy, whereas manualy searching books is difficult,"" says @PERSON1, an eighth grade student from @LOCATION2. As you can see, computers make research a much easier process for citizens. According to a recent @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 are involved in a long-distance relationship. Maintaining a long-distance relationship can be quite difficult. However, with the help of their computers, many couples succeed. Due to recent technologies, couples can now email, @CAPS6, or videochat on their computers. Citizens can also use these services to keep in touch with distant friends or family. For example, many of my relatives live in @LOCATION3, and by using email on the computer, we are able to communicate frequently and maintain a close bond. Overall, computers make long-distance communication/relationships manageable. When most adults need to purchase an item, they drive to a local store or supermarket. However, something as simple as this could prove to be impossible to a disabled person. Before the public used computers, disabled persons had to rely on friends or family to retreive their groceries and clothes. Using the computer, citizens can now order groceries, purchase houseware, and buy clothes. This is especially helpful to disabled people, since they can care for themselves while in the comfort of their own home. According to the @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT2 of disabled persons rely on the computer to purchase necessary items. Naturally, computers greatly enhance the @CAPS2 of disabled persons and provides them with a convienent alternative to outdoor shopping. In final conclusion, I believe computers improve the @CAPS2 of society. Whether they are used to speed up research and projects, connect with friends and family all over the world, or purchase things online. Computers truly benefit everyone. As long as people are still excercising and interacting with others, computers make peoples' lives easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable. As the principal of my middle school once said, ""Computers are an invaluable tool, and, when used properly, can help you succeed in @CAPS2."" @CAPS7 is clear that computers help us to become a more informed, intelligent, and poised society as a whole.",,,,3282,32,523,877,16.34375,512,2.45,1,253,0,166,95,43,35,24,59,2,0,0,1,0

People around the world love to spend most of their time on the computers why well I have three reason why because there's special cool programs, amazing sites, also chat roomsÉ @CAPS1 move on to the first reasons why people spend most of there time on their computer. ""@CAPS2 my god the special cool programs are awesome"", these special programs can be educational to kids, teens, and adults. These programs can teach you how to speak any langue you choose. Their are many types of programs that are helpful to anyone in the world. It doesnt hurt to learn something you havent learn yet. Also not so bad to want to be on the computer for a while. While people enjoy learning cool things people also spend most of their time on their computer to visit new amazing site's people go on game site's to have a little fun indoors insteed of being outdoors so much. There are thousands of games to play from action to dress up games and all the games people enjoy no problem with that dont you agree with my thought about this. Well you should @CAPS1 go on foward with more reasons. You would find that most teens and adults enjoy chating with a friend who lives thousands of miles away from you. Most sites of chat rooms people stay on are @CAPS3.com, facebook, formspring.me ect. People love it because you can design ur on page write a little about yourself put up pictures of you and your friend and write about them. I say you should agree that useing ur computer most of the time dont hurt...

Other people use them for busnessAs letters and send work to there bosses. On @CAPS1 there was a man and he not on an @CAPS2 trio with his family and every time his family what to be he would pull out his laptop / computer to work on the letter as had to send to his boss he never finish the table and never set but his computer set stolen and the man used the computer to look up words for songs so he could learn them. and the other got use his to finish the email and send it to his boss it took to do it what I am saying is that everyone was a laptop to do some thing, to talk to friends or to play games when they have nothing else to do.

These are my reasons why I belive tha computers do benefit our society. My first reason is that we should still have computers because we are still able to interact with our family and friends and enjoy nature. My aunt is a very busy person, she almost never has time to talk or hang out with her friends so the way the communicate is by email and video chat so what @CAPS2 trying to say is many people in my city are very busy they almost dont have anytime to interact other if they have computers they would be able to. My second reason on why we should have computers is because it teaches people many things like hand-eye cordination. Not many people learn in an easy way but on the computer there are websites and links that can teach people how to use their hands in a quick and proper way. My third reason is if adults are planning to go on a trip to a far a way place but have no time to check out books or make reservations through the phone the could go onto the internet during and took up places they would enjoy to go to, They could make reservations on-line too. How would you feel if you were never able to make reservations on the line or online because theres no compoters? How would you see what the places look like? Okay now that you've heard my reasons on why computers are a great help what do you think? A world with computers is great but imagine a world without computers at home, a busy day not going to be home on time so wanna watch the news but theres no computers??

They get addicted to being on line with friends then paying attention to things that really matter. But compputers is also a device that makes life easier for a lot of things. Having a computer a good things or a bad thing. I have no clue. Some example of good things that a computer can be used for is learning. The thing that gets you through life or economy countrys around the world, And can also help the world too. By buying things over the interent, and aslo finding a @CAPS6 @CAPS7.Also speaking of meeting people you can also get in contract with people you haven't seen in ages. Compoters make life so much easier for everyone around. But there are also bad things about computers too. It's very easy to get into a lot of trouble by doing one thing. Things like going on websites like myspace, facebook and so on. @CAPS5 you put one bad thing on like a comment or a photo people start thingking of you in a bad way.

8925,1,My opinion of the effect computers have on people is that people arent safe. A lot of teens and kids on on their computers and go to yahoo + or my space to talk to their friends. but sometimes teen talk to people they donÕt know that can hurt them and tell them something that makes them uncomfortible. I like computers really I do and I know you like it too but sometimes you have to be careful when you surfing the web . Another effect computers have on people is that people arnt healthy. Kids and teens even abults dont go outside to exercise or get fresh air because they are too busy at their house playing on their computer. That why alot of kids and adults gain alot of weigh because they dont stop messing with their computer. you would not want to get fat because your not takeing care of your body because you are playing on the computer. My third reason computer have effect on people is that they arent learning. Kids are just play mini games on their computes and arent leaning anything. They can have homworke and forget how to do it because they was too busy play games on their computer. They could go to school and then a teacher can be teaching them somthing like math. The lesson the kids could be thinking about the game they play on their computer. Like how to pass a level in the games or how to score points. and after the lesson is over they wouldnt learning anything because they wasnt paying attection you wouldnt want your kids spent too much time on the computer and not know anything.

8922,1,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 there has been a lot of debating and arguing going on about the benefits that computers have on society, and specifically if it is currently helping people on a daily basis, or @CAPS5 making it worse for them. Those who support technological advances are especially supportive of the opinion that computers only have a positive affect on life. As much as I like computers, and use them also, I am here today to tell you why it's use and advances should become limited. My first reason as to why computers aren't @CAPS5 affecting society for the better positively, is one that I'm sure that experts will support: exercise time. With all that technology offers today, how will we have time to exercise? ""@CAPS2 with computers I hardly have time to go to the gym"" and ""I haven't worked out in a long time, ever since I bought a new laptop"", are comments that are typically heard. Personally, I don't blame these people! I too find it very hard to fit in ""working out"" on my agenda, ever since I bought a home computer. However, doctors say (and studies @CAPS3) that daily exercise is esential for a physical and mental well-being, along with longitivity. This is especially true and important for children, who are starting to use computers more and more. This brings me to my second reason as to why use of technology should be limited. Even though exercise is one thing computers have taken away from many people (especially children), they also create many other short and long term health hazards, including eye damage, obesity, brain damage and heart problems. As frightening as this @MONTH1 seem, it is all true. How can these computers even be sold legally? Although most of these issues happen after prolonged use of a computer (usually hours at a time), doctors have estimated that this will affect alot more people since children begin using computers at a much younger age. ""I don't want my child to grow up to be blind!"" is what one mother told me after hearing about this. From personal experience, I @CAPS4 that after using my computer for @CAPS5 an hour, I can't see very clearly so imagine over years of usage! Lastly, computer use (especially at a younger age) affects something very important in our system: survival instincts. It has been medically proven that since so much information can be found using a computer, that we grow a dependance for it! What will happen if computers dissapear one day? ""@CAPS5 think of the @CAPS6!"" my neighboors exclaimed. Even I use the computers maps alot, and sometimes, if I am without one, I will forget where I am! It doesn't seem big at first, but it can cause alot of damage in the long run. These are my reasons as to why computer use should be limited. I can understand how some people create them to help us, but the truth is that they are doing @CAPS5 the opposite. I hope you take my opinion into consideration.",,,,2896,28,518,795,18.5,509,3.23,1,240,0,124,102,37,44,15,69,1,0,0,1,1

Computers allow you to type essays, project captions, etc. It gives teachers a break from messy writing for good! @CAPS1 can always rely on @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 to correct their spelling and grammar. Teachers love an edited paper that they can understand completely. Surely, computers are great for education at schools. @CAPS1 and adults can use computers for reseach.

Experts say people spend more time on the computer rather than exercising. The computer provides information supporting your health and fitness. Not only can a computer provide new information about jobs, careers, and your health but also new academic information. Children and adults can go online and find accurate information about academic subjects. Computers have benefits to mine and millions of others everyday lives. More and more students go online everyday to participate in school subjects on the internet. Students have the ability to find out and complete homework assigned to them through simple websites such as classjump.com or studyisland.com. it has been brought to my attention a student might be spending more time on the computer but after the student has completed the assignment he or she can continue their daily activities. Also, some websites have walkthroughs on how to perform a certain experiment or math complication. Lastly, students are able to write papers on the computer, print them out, and have them ready for the teacher. The computer has made a students and teachers life easier @CAPS5 the computer. The last reason computers bring benefits to society is you are able to interact with people online. Certain websites can help you stay in contact with family members who have moved or lost touch with. The internet also provides safe websites to meet new people or catchup with old high school reunion over a public website. Computers provide the information to interact with people you have lost contact with. As you can see, a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and screen have done wonders to many citizens lives. Using this devise has let people have the ability to learn on a computer. Also, it has let students get a brighter education. Last, the computer has given people the opportunity to stay in touch with old friends or family. The computer has its negatives too, but has twice as many positives.",,,,2927,30,485,790,16.1666666667,479,2.45,1,214,2,159,92,41,17,23,54,0,0,0,0,0
8930,1,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers are a part of our everyday lives in this centry. Everywhere you go technology is always being used. This is why I strongly bealive that computers have a positive effect on us. They impact so many useful things. First computer help us to do things faster and easyer. Sencond they are the new social networks that help comunicating online. Lastly they help organize files like in offices. These are the reasons I bealive computers have a big positive effect on society. My first reason was computers help us do things a lot faster. For example, doing research you just type in the topic and in seconds you have thousands of webpages to look from. Way faster then going from book to book looking for the information you need. Also shopping never got easyier with online shopping. Its fast and easy insted of having to go through the hosel of driving far to a store when you can do it instently. People have very busy lives and computers just make it a whole lot easyer. My second reason is computers are the new social network and comunication all over the world! Everyone wants to keep up with their friends, but we cant always have the time to see there. So online chatting helped us fix that. Or when your on the phone you can only have a one way conversation... Boring. but on computers wow you can talk up to as many people that you want simotanisly. Alot for big companys that work with other countries computers helped them alot because they can talk about things without having to always use the companys money to fly out over there. Saving Society time and money! Computers come with webcams so its like your comunicating in person even if they live millions of miles away. This is why computers are help in the social society. The last reason why computer are a positive impact on todays society is because they are the best storing machines ever. Alot of offices have alot of papers and they can always get easly lost or misplaced. however, with computers its a fast way to store the information offices need. Just think about it going to a office with no computers it would take forever to find the papers and information beacause they would have to look from files to files. This is why companys store all their information on the computer. It's just simply fast and easy. These are the three reasons why I strongly bealive that computers are a possitive effect on society. First you can do all your reaseach fast and online, shopping never been easyer. Secondly, online comunications are fast and easy to keep in touch. And lastly it helps offices organize their stuff better. As a result of this you can agree with me that computers are very possitive and they make our lives so much easyier.

It can get your hands faster and stronger. Also you will be more alert when your talking to people or trying to focus on your homework or something like that with a computer you can talk or even meet new friends.

In fact, I read in the ""Time"" magazine that over @PERCENT1 of the people in the @LOCATION1 have changes the way they are and how they act in their everyday life. I for one, believe that computers don't benefit society. My first reason why I beleive that computers don't benefit society is that more and more kids are starting to stay inside on the computer all day rather than going out to play and get exercise. If all the kids in the @LOCATION2 stayed inside all day everyday would be filled with sick and obese children. If the world gets filled with that, it would be total kayoss and people would be left and right the world and humanity as we know it could be destroyed kids are definilly not benefited from at all. That is my first reason why I beleive that computers don't benifit our society. My second reason for why - beleive that computers are not a benifit to society is their people will lose the ability to communicate. In the world to day, people communicate talking face to face, and on the computer. If more and more people start to communicate threw the computer, eventually people won't talk face to face. Communication is a big part of society. Communication is what keeps the world running the way it does. If computers get in the way of that, some bad and dangerous things happen for example, the computer in the space shuttle failed in @DATE1 and that are computer took @NUM1 lives. That is my second reason why computers don't benefit our society. My last reason for why that computers dont benefit our society is that people lose the ability to work. Most things in our world today are all computerized. People aren't doing much work except. If everything is computerized, people will lose the ability to work, what if computers fails, people going to do their jobs if they don't have a clue about what to do? That is my last reason why I beleive that computers do not benefit our society. So, in conclusion, I beleive that computers do not benefit our society.

For example it lets them count faster and not make a mistake on the withdraw or mess up on the deposite. Second if they didn't exercise befor what makes them want to exercise now? On the law it said ""freedom of rights"" so they don't have to exercise if they don't want to.

8933,1,"Dear Readers of the local Newspaper, @NUM1 @CAPS1 has come to my concern that many people are debating weather the good out weighs the bad on computers. I'm writing this letter to state my opinion, computers have a greater negitive effect on people. First of all, computers increase the chance of pediphilies being able to get away with their successful crime. Also, there are also many cybes-bullies on the internet. Thirdly, c hildren and teens often choose going on the computer over exercising. Did you know before the internet there were @PERCENT1 less pediphile crimes than after introduced to children? as technology in our world increases, @CAPS1 becomes easier for @LOCATION1 to kidnap children. some kids are being introduced to internet without parental guidance, kidnapping children is easier than ever for @LOCATION1. Now @PERCENT2 of children who go online without parental vision are kidnapped and reaped of that @PERCENT2, @PERCENT3 are then murdered. Do we want to put our kids at that kind of risk? You might be saying ""ohh that will never happen to my kids, I watch what they do online!"" @CAPS2, your kids can go on while your not looking. These days @PERCENT4 of children over @NUM2-years-old can turn on the computer and get to a chat room by themselves. Chat rooms are the home to @PERCENT5 of all @LOCATION1. Why would you want to put children in the kind of situation? Not only are chat rooms to over @NUM3 @LOCATION1, they also hold over @NUM7.@NUM2 @CAPS3 cyber bullies. Your kids or teens could be harassed on the internet by cyber-bullies every day. This will ruin their self-esteem and could lead your kids into depression. There are a total of about @NUM5 @CAPS3 people who visit chat roooms. That gives your child (or children) a @NUM6 in @NUM7 chance that they will chat with a cyber-bully each time they go on the internet. why put your child in that kind of emotional torture? The internet can murder your child literally by introducing them to @LOCATION1 or @CAPS1 can cause your child to commit suicide after being cyber-bullied. But the internet can also cause your child to die of obesity causes. The time your child spend on the internet takes away from the time they be exercising. Did you know @PERCENT6 of children in @LOCATION2 don't exercise the recommended @NUM8 minutes a-day. Did you know @PERCENT7 of those kids spend atleast an hour on the internet every day? If we took away the computer from them they would probably spend that time exercising. That would improve the health of our children and increase their life expectancy. Don't you want your children to be healthy? Do you want your child or the children in our community to encounter a pediphile? Do you want them to be cyber-bullied? Do you want more and more children to become obease? If you answered no to of these questions you would agree that the negitive out weighs the positive for computers. Sure, the computer can get you alot of information about faraway places, but can't books do the same? ",,,,3010,35,521,784,14.8857142857,501,1.67,1,232,0,148,102,31,27,12,71,0,0,0,1,1

Some parents complain that their kids are playing games when they should be learning, but now, plenty of games are mixing in math and reading. Most people just sit and sleep and do nothing when their bored. If they go on the computer not only will it give them something to do, but it can teach them things that they should learn. Computers can be good hobbies for a lot of people. Many parents let their children go on the computer and play whatever they want. Parents then think their children are playing games that are not helping them, but that is not true most games are teaching their kids how to do difficult math problems, and to have better reading skills. Say if you had to tell somebody that your father is in the emergency room and you didn't have anywhere to contact them, with a computer you can type to them imediatly, or even talk on a webcam to see each other.

Computers can let you interact with friends, research, and ask questions. These things can increase your knowledge, and you can talk to your friends at the same time. First, I think computers have good effects on people because you can interact with friends. Sites like facebook can allow you to reconnect with your old friends, and see how their doing in life. You can look at pictures, chat with your friends and past what you want on it. Next, you can use @CAPS4 to talk with your friends. You can type to them and you can even video chat and see them through the computer. Finally you can watch youtube videos. You can subscribe to a friend's channel an watch cool videos. You can learn from same of the videos. In conclusion, I think computers have good effects on people because you can interact with friends. Next, I think computers have good effects on people because you can research. You can research topics you want to know about, and topics you would like to learn. Secondly, you can research important information. The information can be on something for school, or a project. Lastly, you can reasearch different experiments. You can research it for science, and then do the experiment. You can learn a lot from a singel experiment. To sum up, I think computers have good effects on people because you can research. Finally, I think computers have good effects on people because you can ask different questions. You can ask questions you ahve about homework. I know I always have a question with my homework, and I can always go to the computer and look it up. Also, you can ask about anything. There are websites like yahoo and ask. com that can tell you the answers. Thirdly, you can ask questions about information that is useful to you. For example, it can be about something you're learning in school, something your parents want yout to know about, or just something you would like to know about.

Also you could go blind, wearing you might think that the computer screen is. Another thing is that you won't be able to open you're eye. Because it would hurt way to much.

Lastly, computers are a source of amusements, somewhere we can go listen to music, play games and just generally have fun! Computers certainly have a positive efect on society. So many of us use networking sights such as facebook, myspace and @CAPS1, I'm sure you do too! I can see now someone could make an argument saying how these sights distract us from more important things but really, I see these website as a source of communication. With facebook, and myspace, you can meet new people, while still being safe of course, and you can also stay in touch with family members you don't see often or even old friends. I know i've stayed close with all my cousins because of @CAPS1 can help you see what your friends weddings and even emailing is also a good source. it also helps you stay in touch with people, but by writing letters back and fourth. Even though now you all work for our local newspaper, i know there was a time were you had a school paper due and had to look through a book for hours. it wasnt fun, was it? Well now, with we can google a topic fast and find information in a matter of seconds this helps everyones grades in school.

Just admit it, computers are a very handy electronic to have. if you haven't talked to your cousin or uncle a while, easy just log onto facebook and quickly write on their wall.

My mom always says ""You can't go on the computer until you're done with you're homework!"" @CAPS2 is one reason why parents shouldn't worry so much. The computer helps you learn too. There are plenty of educational games on the computer. There are million games that help teach kids about math and spelling and just about any other subject there is. I know that my little sister is always on the computer looking for games to help with spelling. @CAPS5, most teachers in my school have a @CAPS3 of events and homework that we'll get in class posted on our school website, I don't know where I would be without that! There is even a school calendar online! The last reason i think computers are wonderful is that they help heal people! This @MONTH1 sound a little wierd, I thought so too, when I first nead it in a magazine. there is a guy named @PERSON1 who has a disability where his brain doesn't function correctly. He has trouble recogniziing numbers, letters and shapes. His doctor did not only prescribe a amedication but he also prescribed a video game! This was a special game that had to do with speech. It was a racing game where a letter, number, @CAPS4 or picture would pop on the screen of the computer and the person playing would have to say into a microphone what it was. Only when the person got it right could the car advance to the finish line. After two months of playing that game @PERSON1 told his doctor. This game is amazing.

People are missing out in a lot of interesting things going on because their alway at home in the computer. Computers are a good source for information but now a days people are taking advantage of it, instead of only using it when needed people are spending one through four hours in the internet doing nothing productive when they can be doing many more active things. People should be exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends instead of spending countless hour chatting with someone perhaps they don't even know. Acording to a couple of surveys taken at different schools seventy @PERCENT2 of kids are spending time on things like facebook, myspace, and twitter the doing their homework, kids are falling back in school and their grades are droping all because of computers this clearly states computers are not benefitial for society. Another topic that clearly shows computers don't have a positive effect on people is cyberbulling. Ciberbullying is giving people a much bigger chance to be a victim of constant bullying. Another survey states that @PERCENT1 of kids in a school have gotten threat mail or have exposed to some kinds of bullying over the computer. Kids take a big part of things going wrong because of computers now a days. On line you can connect with over millions of people whom you don't know, this people can pretend to be anyone they want since their not talking face to face with other people like it should be; the scary thing about this is this people can be sexual predators who are looking for ways to kidnap kids and over the computer is one of the easiest way for this to be done. There has been many reported cases where kids or adults are posting things up in the internet that could cause alot of harm in their lifes. People that are posting volgur or inapropriate things up can get in trouble with the law, not only that but something a kid put up in the internet years ago could be the cause of them not getting into a collage or getting a job later on in life because thing can be traced back and once you put something up in the internet for the world to see it will forever stay there and will never be erased.

Being able to be allowed to learn the importants and benefits to hand - eye coordination is something that every child should work with as they are growing up. I am working with this club, @CAPS3, to help the challenged students how to have fun and use of the technology we have @DATE1: for example computers. Not having computers in your every day life style is like not have food for a whole day, you need @CAPS2. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and being able to do that is great for work purposes and school work. Through my years of being in school has lead my to having to use the computer in some way shape or form. Whether @CAPS2 is studing for a test or working on a project I need the computer and I need my hand-eye coordination. With the computer technology that we have @DATE1 has allowed people to be able to talk on line with each other through @CAPS4 or video chatting. In my personal sake having close family members live in another state is hard to see them. Having computers and using the video chat is the best thing because we now know how each other is doing. Having all of the technology that we are using to this date is something that our society should hold on to for every and maybe be improved. Helping other people and yourself with hand-eye coordination is a great way to help out body language. Having the computer for educational purposes and using them to look up places or people is a wonderful thing to have. Online video chatting is great for people that have friends or family that live faraway. All of the disagreements should become an agreement to having computers benefit in the society.",,,,2133,16,383,591,23.9375,380,5.18,1,156,0,103,86,23,8,19,45,1,0,0,1,0
8943,1,"I personally love computers, but we don't really need them. Although computers can be useful, they can also be addictive. Sure computers teach hand-eye coordination, but these are many other ways to do so. With computers, kids don't get enough exercise. These are other ways to talk to people other than by a computer. My opinion is, that they are addictive, these are other ways to learn hand-eye coordination and talk to people, and finally kids do need to exercise more. Computers can be addictive, if you let them. I understand how computers are faster and easier to look up information. The world wide web has anything you can think of. I have a set of encyclopedias at my house. Before I had internet access, I would use those on school projects. Sure computers are faster, but you don't know if the information you get is right. The internet gets hacked everyday, and things become changed with books like encyclopedias, no one can change the information that are on those pages. Then these are people that get addicted to games on the computer. If you want to play games, then go out with your friends and do mini-golf or something that involves exercise. So computers are addictive and that will cause problems in if it gets to bad. There are other ways to learn things. For example, if you want to learn hand-eye coordination play baseball. Not only baseball, but there are many sports that involve hand-eye coordination. Some are soccer (if your goalie), basketball (also your shooting), volleyball, and football. On computers, you learn how to email and. There are also webcam chats that you actually to other person. That is good and all, but you could call them or if you really want to talk. By going to ther house you are getting out, and getting some fresh air. So don't learn things by the computer, read, talk to people, there are many other ways. In sixth grade, I learned the fact that the @LOCATION1 in the world. You can blame all the fast-food restraunts we have. That plays half of the reason, but the other half is that people don't exercise enough. I have told you that computers are addicting. That addictive quality is keeping people on computers for hours straight. They look up and its dark out. They just shrug their shoulders get something to eat and then get right back on the computer. They skip exersizing and the whole day to be on the computer. I know I said that kids don't get enough exercise, but it's adults too. Computers keep people from exercising and thats a fact. In conclusion, computers are addictive, there are other ways to learn things and people in general don't get enough exercise. I said before that I love computers, but we don't need them to do everything. I'm not saying ban computers all together, but try to cut down on how much you use them.",,,,2803,38,506,727,13.3157894737,500,1.28,0,192,1,107,120,37,36,26,50,0,0,0,0,0

First of all, the computer provides a means of education, I was doing my sicence homework, yesterday and I wanted to know what number planet we were form the sun and I found a very nice digram of the universe. Also do sicentcs have all the same knowlage no, so they find another scientest notes on the computer. I also thought the computer had all this information so we wouldn't have to look it up in a big heavy book. Computers not only provide information but they also provide a means of comunitation between people. Second of all the computers provides an acclent form of comunition. For example, why pay for texting when you can instant message for free on the computer. Also, some new computers have web camreras so, people can some what talk face to face. And, there are suspific programs for comunitation for example; myspace, twitter, facebook and aim. Third of all, the computer provides many tools to be used get your disposial for example why tear up your house looking for a calculator when there is one on your computer? I have a friend that writes slower than a snail moveing but, if she is typeing he can write a three page essay in thirtey miniets. My personal faverate tool is paint it has helped me create many posters for school. By using those tools it is developeing the skill hand-eye cordination. Last but not least the computer teaching hand eye cordination. @PERSON1 has confirmed that @PERCENT1 of people that use computers have see a increase in hand eye cordination. My ocupational theeripest has made me type to see how well I am doing. Lastly the typeing increaces the rate at witch the your cordination increases.

Finally, I believe computer have a positive effect on because it teaches, hand-eye coordination.

On the @CAPS2 you can find out things like weather, sports event, there alot of real thing people on the @CAPS2. Also, some people say that people on the computer, and I think it is a lie because people can be look for a job website or something that for help become in shape to.

8947,1,"Although computers can supply people with tons of information, it can also take up one's time. If a person is playing a game they @MONTH1 become addicted. The computer can also start online fights between two teens on a chatting site. Computers become the number one focus of that persons life. Students wake up late because they were up the night before on their laptop. A kid can get a membership to an online game. With so many things to learn and catch inside this virtual world, the real world is blocked out. This kid will wake up early and stay up late inorder to beat the beast or earn enough coins for a potion. They lose track of time and don't really care until their parent reminds them they have school the following day. You forget about everything going on around you.

With no one getting physical you aren't scared to talk trash. You stay up all night arguing with this person. Things can get really bad.

They can miss so much in the first fiteen minutes of class. It is all thanks to them staying on their laptop the whole night before. Over-sleeping too much can eventually cause a problem. You can't come to school late everyday. You miss too much. All of this is to blame on a simple computer. It can seem like @NUM1 hours went by as if it were @NUM1 minutes.

8950,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers benefit society? My answer is yes. I believe that computer benefit society in many ways. One reason would be that computers teach you good hand-eye coordination. You can easily improve you reflexes and coordination by using a computer. I can say this because i am very fond of computers. I would have to say that i have good hand-eye coordination just by looking at how well i use a computer. I would have to say from experience that computers very much help my coordination. Accoring to the latest study on the topic by @ORGANIZATION2, an average person can improve their coordination by up to @PERCENT1. @ORGANIZATION2 programer, @PERSON1, says,"" @CAPS2 hand-eye coordination isn't just done by our programs, computers themselves seem to have that effect on people.

The way that computer can improve you skills so easily is almost like magic. Computers also help you learned keyword for this would be ""research.""

8949,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I believe that computers have more positive effects than bad. Using the computer can improve hand-eye coordination skills. It can also introduce new experiences and people. Not only that but it is an excellent source of entertainment. This is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. First, using the computer helps build hand-eye coordination skills. You learn the functions and uses of the internet. Also, instead of hand-writing your school assignments, you can just type it! When you start using a computer, you can usually notice that your typing skills improve. For example, when I first used a computer in the second grade, I typed with speed of a turtle! Now, I can type much faster, allowing me to accomplish many more things in a shorter amount of time. Second, the computer opens up a whole new world of experiences and people! You can browse places, and admire many famous tourist sites. For example, using computer, you can see the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @LOCATION1! Not only that, but you can also meet new people online, and make new friends. If you want to talk with all your school friends at once, you can also bring everyone intoa chat room, and talk there! Although, even computers have their faults, some say that using computers limits a person's time for other activities, such as going outside, or playing with friends. I do have to admit this can be true, but computers wouldn't be the only cause! Computers are a quick way to interact with others, and don't actually take up that much time. If you want to play with friends, you can find online-multiplayer games! Finally, the computer is an excellent source of entertainment. You can watch movies online even! If you can't go outside to play on a rainy day, you can find an online game to pass the time. You can also do your work online, and order things faster. For example, most people do their taxes online, and if they don't feel like going out, the can order for a pizza delivery online, too! I believe computers have positive effects. They can improve hand-eye coordination skills. Also, the computers opens up experieinces and introduces people. If you're ever bored, the computer is a @CAPS3 way to pass the time.

Computers is a good technology to use. You can do lots of things. Students are addicted to computers because of all the things you can do with it. Like for an example me, I love going on the computer to play games, do research for my dream job and to keep in contact with my cousins from @LOCATION1. My first statement or you can say reason, is about research. People need to do research on things. Computers help us students look up things we need to know. Like for a homework assignment, you can do a research on it. People can learn about places all over the world and about different cultures and regions. Everybody needs a computer to look up definitions. If people dont want to use an computer, then they can use an dictionary. That just more work because you have to look threw pages and with a computer all you have to do is go to @LOCATION2 and type in the word they have plenty of definition. You can learn anything on a computer, like sign language. Computers also can look up different types of translations for different language. One of my main reasons is to get in contact with family and friends. You can send emails to them instead of writing letters. Computers can be an addicted technology, but kids love it. Some teenagers stay on the computer and then later they go to hangout with friends. The only time we go on the computer in school is during some of are specials but we use them to do research. So now that you see that students need computers to help us with our work. We also can get in contact with friend and family at the same time. We also use computers to type of reports and essays.

8952,1,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Have you ever thought about if computers are actually good for people? If you ask me I think they could do some good to you but more bad things would happen then good. First it stops people from getting exercise, also people get addicted, what would happen if somes computer had a problem. Have you ever thought about these things. I have and I am here to tell you why computers are not good. First I believe that computers stop people from getting any exercise. If people don't get excersis then they @MONTH1 become over weight. I don't think that anyone wants thats not only this but it also bad habbits for people. For example people eat as they are on the computer if you watch someone do this you feel discusted. Before computers around my house everyone played outside, but now its like a gost town. Not only do computers stop people from getting excercise but also people get addicted to the computer. Second I think that people can get addicted to the computer. To me the closest thing I think of to this is but in a computer, I know it @MONTH1 sound strange but its @PERCENT1 true is a drug that is very addictive once you are on it its hard to get off and its the same with a computer. Also the computers can get people in trouble. For example your mom tells you to get off for dinner and you say one minute and that minute turns into one hour. This is what I mean when I say addictive. Yes computers do help actually look at it a majority of people are. Lastly I know that computers naturally have problems. For some people if your computer breaks down you find something else to do, but for most people it would be the end of the world. This could cause a person to become not mad. This is because they are looking at a computer screen @NUM1 and don't get off to see what is happening around them. One thing that gets me mad is when my computer is going extremely slow and I know this gets other people mad as well. So now do you think that computers are raelly good for people?

8953,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I have read a study about concerns on computers to society. I say that computers do not benifit society. They are addicting, so people spend way too much time on it, instead of excersising. Also, computers take away peoples' opprotunities to enjoy nature and the outdoors. Computers can pull you away from your family and friends. Those are the reasons why computers do not benifit society. To begain with, computers are replacing excersise. Before computers were invinted children playal outdoors until sundown. Now, there are barely any children running around outdoors. Since computers were introduced to society there has been a eighty-five percent increase in childhood obesity. Kids are not the only ones suffering from the computer addiction, so are adults. Some adults spend as many hours on the computer as their children. In fact, some adults don't excersise of all because they are glued to their computer monitar. Computers help causs obesity and this reason. In addition, computers take away our oporutunities to nature. People spend their time indoors now. Instead of hiking up a maintain or strolling through the park, most people are indoors chatting on @CAPS2 or watching t.v. on @LOCATION1. Most people nowadays don't get to observe the changing of. the blosum of flowers in the @DATE1. One thing computers can't do for you is let you enjoy the wonderful world.

My sister spends many hours on the computer every day and personally I don't see her out of her mom often. I understand that people get to meet knew friends over the internet, but you also lose ones that you already have. @CAPS1, you have to inform people of this destruction of social life by computers. Many families don't go to the park together or have a family nigiht anymore thanks to computers. Families need to be reunited, so take away the computer monitors. In conclusion, computers do not benifit society. They take away time from excersising. Computers can't help you enjoy nature.

Now that technology is becoming a larger part of peoples daily lives, it is creating less time for humans to enjoy and take part in everyday activities. I truely believe that computers have a negative affect on people and technology taking time away from many important aspects of human life. To continue, as people are spending more and more time on computers, there is less time for activities that help peoples well being and health. First of @CAPS2, time spent on the computer leaves less time for exercising. Exercise is an important aspect of human life and a reccent survey of people living in @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that half of the town does not have time in their schedule for @NUM1 minutes of exercise a day. This is a major problem because more and more people will. Also, those without on a higher risk of having health problems. Another survey of people in @LOCATION1 has shown that people living in a day on the computer. If instead that time on the computer was spent @LOCATION1's people would have a healthier life cycle. Spending time enjoying the great outdoors and the beauties that activity that people would do more often if these such a large amount of time spent on computers. On the @DATE2 snow day, @NUM2 out of every @NUM3 students asked at they stayed inside and player games on the snowday, instead of enjoying the snowy day. This shows that todays students. time wasteing technology. Another aspect that online communication is slowly getting ride of is interacting and spending time with family and friends. Just @DATE2 my family was planning to go the @LOCATION2 to visit my cousins. Instead of traveling the drive, they decided to skype them? on the computer. Online communication is clearly taking away a toll on the importance of spending time with family and friends.

Time spent on computers takes away time that could be used for exercising making our towns population healtheir in the long run. Computers and the rise of technology are activities like spending time enjoying nature on the back burners.

8957,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers are wonderful. Why because it is a very helpful device. It helps everyone with anything. For example if there is a school project on @PERSON1 instead of books you can use computers to look up anything about him. Thats one way of how a computer is good. Do not worry I have way more in stored for you. My first reason to why computers are good is because it is something you can to when your bored. Like there is webcam so you can see and talk to the person you haven't seen or missed for a long time. Also the webcam is good when you are very sick and you do not or they do not wanna go to your house and get very sick. If you do not know how great a computer works IÕm tell you right now. My second reason as to why a computer is better is because it teaches hand eye coordination. We use hand eye coordination everyday of our life. For instance how do we get to school or work we use hand eye coordination how do we do our work in school or work with hand eye coordination. How do we do hand eye coordination with all things because we are doing something with our hands and looking it with our eyes. These things are very important in the life with out it theres nothing we can do. My third reason why computers are good is because computers search for ones life. The reason I say this is because it helps us find colleges, jobs, and law enforcements. As we all know college is very important and worth taking. Say if I didn't make in the can just take class right and to me on why computers. Me as a kid that by taking up college on the computers.

There are many solutions to this huge problem. Men and women are being affected by this computer and soon people will stop going places at all. No one is ever outside anymore or even just to say hello to a friend. These computers are taking over. With computers on the mind no one has time for exersize. All over america, people are just wasting their lives on the computer. There is no exersize in just sitting on your chair looking at a screen. Most people will sit on the computer and eat too. Most at america is obese right now and fast food is not just the any cause. Not a lot of people go jogging or running anymore because they are now watching someone run online. There are too many distractions that will just not let the american at of his or her name. You don't have to sit on the computer all day. Plan same time to go out and see nature. Fresh air is right outside your door you just have to go at there. Spending time with friends can be a good way to get outside too. Riding bikes is a simple way to get some exersize and be with friends at the same time. If on the computer, you would be sitting on a dare room just the light from the screen eventhough it is a beautiful day at. Another thing outside is all the places to go. Everywhere has many unique things about it that ya would only know by looking it up online. Get outside! One thing you might not know about the computer is that your talking to not real people. If you're in your room all the time. Your family will start to look for you and miss you. You're friends will find new ones. This will all happen because you wouldn't go play with them at the playground or go see a movie. by being on the computer, it has made life not fun and exciting. Meeting new people is all part of that too. If on the computer all day, new people can't make their way into your life. Sometimes other can your old friends that you already knew. So in conclusion, sitting on the computer is not helping anything. There would be no exersize in the picture, friends would worry and nature would be second best. Get off the computer because it will always be there when you get back. Pick up a basketball and shoot hoops with your friends and family. People will start missing out on things that are important to them. So people shoud stop going on computers for long times. Its ok in moderation but not all day everyday.

Computers save people's lives everyday, and without them, the world would be in all chaos. This is just one of many reasons the world needs technology for the greater good.

Computers can gives you information on any topic including exercising and nature lastly using a computer gives you websites to keep in touch with family and friends the technology we have now is great! My first reason for aggreeing with the use of computers is reeping in touch with family and friends. Now-a-days any websites you go an theres a chat regement that means whoever is on that she same time are could chat them so instead of on your family and friends on holidays and gatherings you talk to them every day you want. Also not just website lets you talk to family and friends theres webcams. webcams could actually see the person and talk to them its really really computer is a fantastic idea for keeping in touch. My second search for agreeing with the use of computers is learn things, most importantly being exercise on the computer i understand the reason behind you cant exercise on the computer, this is. but the computer has so many resources to research exercise for you to do and work out so of going out and buying those tapes, just sit home and online and comfort of your own home so the computer is and you could do things from the comfort at your own home. My theird and last reason for agreeing why the use of computers is it lets you explore the world around you comfort at your own home, actually not even leaving your bed. without computers in our we want be able to do projects at school or without having to try the. So finally computers let us see our world with a click a button. So in conclusion I agree with the use of computers.they let us keep in touch with family and friends, also let us research things, like exercising, and lastly let us see our with a click of a button.

8960,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I understand that more and more people use computers now days, but im conserned about people not getting outside more. There not doing activities like excersizing, enjoying nature, and even interacting with there family and friends. I'll explain what im talking about. It's very important that people excersize because it helps there health, heart, and physical appearance. Weight isn't about what you eat only, you also have to burn calories. Your health is important too. If you eat right and excersize then you will live longer and feel better about yourself. Then maybe you want have to visit the doctors more, because a healthy person doesnt get sick very easily if they have high ammune system. Most people love outside, because of the fresh air and animals like birds @CAPS2 squirrels. Fresh air helps people think better. Thats why people say ""@CAPS1 a walk and think"" they say that because it helps. The nature and animals is beautiful. Lots of people like seeing the wild animals and forest. Also, the park is a great place to go to when you want to see dogs @CAPS2 squirrles. I enjoy seeing dogs and their owner play fetch @CAPS2 ball @CAPS2 frisbee. I like seeing the squirrles jump from tree to tree and gather. The last and most important thing is family. Family is there for you through thick and thin. If you interact and talk to them, they can understand. Its important to have a special bond between you and your family. That goes for you friends too. Your friends are special because each one is different. You can gossip with them and you can tell them secrets that you can't tell your family @CAPS2 friends. They are there for you too. Don't loose your friend(s) because your spending to much time on the computer @CAPS3 of hanging out @CAPS2 spending time with your friends. This is because you dont know what you have until its gone. Both family and friends deserve attention and some of your quality time. You can go to a movie, a friends house @CAPS2 play a game. Family and close friends came first before (technology @CAPS2) anything. It doesnt do much for you besides having you waste your time. In conclusion, you see my reasons why im very conserned about people going outside, enjoying nature, and interacting with there family and friends. Its important to every person and they dont realize what there doing because they dont see it. All there thinking about is the computer screen, there not thinking about what there loosing in life.

Computers can be use for various positive things my top @NUM1 things that are benefits are, computers can be uses to talk to friends and family that donÕt live hear you and, computers can also be used to research and learn just about anthing. In addition computers can be used for the work place and for @CAPS2. Still dont think computers benifit the society? Well, read on. First off, Computers can be used to talk to friends and family. You can actually talk like you on a phone with a computer, send instant messages and e-mail. All of these things I mentioned can we use to communicate to almost any one from my where at any time. Isnt that ? Oh and did i mention it's free? Also you can use all this to meed new friends and people. Does this communication sound benifitiohon? My next reason is computers can be used to learn just about anything. Lets say you have a question about something you want answered, and theres, bad weather outside. Where are you going to go? The computer! The computer can be used to access a ton of info instantly. Its basically like ahuge book about everything (with pictures) on a screen! Don't you think learning anything at anytime is a positive effect? My last but not least positive effect of computers is, computers can be used in the work place and for entertainment/@CAPS2. For work computers have a lot of programs to do projects/essays from programs to do slideshows, graphs and simple things like ltters and writing papers. Doing this on the computer saves time, which is important today. Now onto the @CAPS2/entertainment part. If you ever bored you can watch videos, @CAPS2 free games and even shop for things! I think this all is positive and benifitional. The positive effects of computers easily out wieghts the negitive effects. Computers can be used to commicate to many, can be used to learn anything desired and can be used to entertain and make work easier. All of this can help and benifit any one. If you have never used a computer I suggest you try one as soon as possible.

The only person you see stares straight at the ground as he walks by, as if he is afraid to interact with you. You walk into a nearby shop. The only person in the shop is an obese lady. She is sitting in the corner on her @CAPS5. Not effected by your presence. The smell of junk food and sugar fill you nostrils and the enjoying clicking of the keyboard fills you ears. With the growing use of computers, people are not exercising as much, not enjoying nature, and not interacting with other people. Computers definiatly have negative effect on our society. First, to many people are spending too much time on the @CAPS5 and not enough time getting exercise. Sitting at the @CAPS5 all day will just increase the amount of obese people in the world. The amount of obese people is already high, but it is growing at an astonishing rate, due to the over abundance of @CAPS5 usage. A study by the medical department at @ORGANIZATION2 shows that the number of obese people in the @LOCATION1 is increasing by @PERCENT1 every year, this study also @LOCATION1 that computers are the #@NUM1 cause. It is simply not healthy to sit at the @CAPS5 all day. On top of that, it is a fact that when you are sitting at the @CAPS5, you are more prone to over eating. For example, @TIME1 I was playing a game on the @CAPS5, I look out a jumpo bag of chips. I was playing and eating at the same time. Before I knew it, the chips were gone. It was almost as though I didnÕt know I was eating it I though computers are great pieces of technology, the health problems they cause make it not worth it. Would you want this unhealthy fate for yourself? Next, when you are sitting at the @CAPS5 all day, you are not able to enjoy nature. It is a fact that our bodyÕs need fresh air to function properly. @PERSON1, specializing in the effects computers have on our bodys, wrote in his book, Ò@CAPS5 @CAPS6Ó, Ò In order for our bodyÕs to be healthy, they need fresh air and the outside sunlight. Computers are preventing use from getting this. ÒHave you ever been sitting at your @CAPS5 and got a massive headache? Well, people that spend over @NUM2 hours a day straring at the @CAPS5 are more licky to have chronic headaches and eye problems. In fact, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 shows that they are more than @NUM3 times more likely would you want to have serious diseases just because you sat at the @CAPS5 to much?

Now, @CAPS4 that same world I described in the beginning ecept without computers. You walk down the street and people greet you and say hello.

Computer take the work out of everything. So sit back and i will be glad to tell about why computers have a bad effect on society. My @CAPS1 reason why i think computers have a bad effect on society is because of games, teenagers spend way too much time playing games than they do playing with their friends outside, @PERCENT1 of all teens would rather play on the computer than go outside and exercise, And also some of the language or scenes in these games are a little inappropriate for younger children, @CAPS2. @PERSON1 says that too little kids are learning bad things from these games. This is one of my reason why computers have bad effects on people. My record  why i think computer you a bad effect on people is because of blogs. Also too many kids these days are always updating their blogs. Always wanting to see what their friends are saying or doing. And it's been proven that @PERCENT2 of people go on to or update their blogs at least @NUM1 times a day. And the language are people is . I admit i have a blog but i don't go on al the time life some of my friends do. This is my second reason why i think  a bad effect on people. Kid is   are so lazy that they won't even get a book once in while and look something of they usually just go to their computer get onto the internet and type a lot they want in. John we also says that @PERCENT3 of all people don't go to books for information anymore. They try to get time easy way out. They try to get the easy way out. This is my third reason why computers have a bad effect on people. I hope you have  how many bad effects computers have on people, especially because of the games kids play, blogs and the easy work that people get out and that people should get outside more and play with their friends. Or go work out or do something active.

8965,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing you this letter to give you my opinion about computers. I personally think computers have negative effect. You won't get enough exercise, won't spend enough time with family and friends, and they could be used for inappropriate things. I will now give you my reasons why I think computers have negative effects. First, people who spend too much time on the computer won't get wnough exercise. They will be so involved with their computer they won'r want to go outside and run around. Also, they won't get involved with sports. People who spend too much tiem on the computer, will probably be overweight to begin with. Therefore, they will not want to be involved with sports and other activities. My cousins are on the computer all the time! My aunt has to tell them to get off and go outside. As you can see, computers can defintely affect the amouth of exercise people get. Next, spending too much time on the computer can decrease your amouth of family and friend time. if You probably won't wat to do things with your family, such as sibling sports games, or going out to dinner. It is very important that people get enough family time. Also, you probably won't spend time with friends either if you spend too much time on the computer. You won't want to invite them over your house, and they won't want to invite you over their house. One time I invited my friend over, and she said she didn't want to come because she was on the computer I thought that was very rude. I think you can now see that spending a lot of time on the computer can decrease your family and friend time. Lastly, computers can be used for inapproprriate things. A lot of kids these days look at explicit images, watch bad videos, and listen to bad music. Also, a lot of kids have @CAPS1 where they can be very dangerous, because they might get involved with a bad person. We have a family friends who has @CAPS1 and she was talking to this guy who started saying bad things to her. Now you can see how the computer can be used for inappropriate and dangerous things. In conclusion, I fell computers have a negative effect on people. They prevent people from getting exercise, decrease family and friend time and can be used for inappropriate things.

Robots aren't goign to take over the world, not like int he moveis, but they are slowly getting there into talking over our lives. Computers have been an incredible breakthrough for everyone in the past @NUM1 years or so. It's an amazing piece of technology, but some people are spending way to much time on them, sacrificing exercise, social lives and many things that are going on in the outside world. Don't let those robots take over! Obesity has become a bog problem during these past few years. An increasing @PERCENT1 of children are overweight. Since children and teenagers are the most targeted victims of the computer world, this age group's overweight population is steadily increasing. but why? How do computers make people more overweight? it's not the computers themselves that's making people overweight, it's the attraction. Most teenagers will spend their time on facebook, playing games and chatting with their friends on the computer rather than spend their time being active and palying outside. Computer over-users also aren't talking to their friends in person anymore usually a conversation ends with, ""talk to you later!"" That is usually referring to talking online, not in person. Facebook , for example, is how the world's largest internet used, internationally-connected website. MOst teenagers see their friends picture more than their friend themselves. Isn't it difficult to have a relationship with someone almost completely virtually? In my opinion, that kind of realtionship is not only difficult, it is unwanted. As a child, i used to love receiving letters in the mail. Now, I don;t receive only with development of computers, very few people take the time to write a letter, when they can send a letter by mail. Nobody finds it exciting getting an email. Also computers have become the only fully used source for information. A book or a map is no longer a common way of getting inforamtion.

If any one person was extremely attached to their computers there would be no need for families. If you sit there on the computer all day with no job, family to feed I gurantee that one spouse will file for a divorce, and do you know why? well its because the look in a mothers eye when they cant feed their child or even provide for them. It doesn't take that much to cause sorrow. Finally, people should stay away from those death machines because it disrupts the learning environment. If students use a computer for every challenge that they ""think"" they cant overcome they will gurantee, @PERCENT1 be more dependent on the computer than their brains.

Because people are spending so much time on the computer they are not doing important thing like working out, or taking care of their health. They are just sitting there. A man named @PERSON1 was once very fit, very successful, and very rich. He started joining @CAPS1, myspace and twitter, then thats all he ever did. He gained almost @NUM1 pounds. Why you @MONTH1 ask? He stopped exercising, because he filled up that time by being on the computer. No one should turn out like @PERSON1 did, but it's happening all the time. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of things on the computer are unsafe or spam? Yet that is what students are one click away from all the time? What if you are on skype and start talking to a random person then decide you two want to mee? How can you feel safe on the computer? The truth: you can't. This is not the only thing. There is cyber bullying all the time, @CAPS5 things are major issues and if we don't face them they will be @CAPS5 forever. In conclusion computers have a very bad effect on people from being time consuming. to obesedy, to unsafe places on the internet and spam. Think about all of this, then decide what you think, and do something about it.",,,,2267,34,421,578,12.3823529412,412,0.89,1,190,0,106,89,27,39,14,52,0,0,0,1,1
8971,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I strongly believe that today's advances in technology and usage of computers are having a negative effect on people. When people spend too much time on the computer, they get less exercise, don't spend much time with their family and friends, and subject themselves to hidden dangers that lurk behind the seemingly harmless exterior of the internet. Please let me further explain my thoughts... Firstly, people who spend too much time on their computers are proven to not get enough exercise! The average teenager will spend hars social networking with friends or people they don't even know, but will not spare half an hour to take a nice walk outside. ""The human body,"" says fitness expert @PERSON1, ""was not meant to stare at a glowing screen for hours at a time. Everyone, from every age group, needs to fit some physical activity in their daily routine to stay healthy."" People who do not exercise their bodies could become dangerously obese, or could develop other problems such as heart disease. Clearly, computers are a mjaor contributor to the shrinking number of people who exercise every day. My second reason why i believe computers can be harmful is that people or the internet don't send enough time socializing with family or others. A survey by the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that one of the main reasons familities split up is because they don't spend any quality time with each other. If you don't even know the people you are closest to how can you develop social skills you'll need later in life? Negotiation skills, the ability to get along with fellow human beings, and basic compassion and etiquette are all abilities that must be cultivated out in the real world, because that is where they will be put to use. As you can see, it would be socially beneficial if we to limit our the on the computer. Finally, people who spend too much time on the internet are subjecting themselves to hidden dangers such as identity theft. Over @PERCENT1 of all identity thieves have taken their trade to the worldwide web, where it is easier to steal the necessary numbers and components to open a person's bank account and ruin them. Further, many adolescents, particularly females, who are victims of kidnapping or sexual assault say that they first met their attacher on the internet. Just a few seemingly benevalent convirsations can be enough for a predator to locate their next victim. It would seem evident that the internet, while having its benefits, harbors many dangers that become real as soon as you log on. In conclusion, i think the risks of over using a computer outweigh the benefits. My reasons are that users don't get enough exercise, people on the computer don't socialize with their fellow human beings, and that there are hidden dangers that nearly all computer users are subject to. I hope that we see eye to eye in this matter and that in the future, actions could be taken to present the previously described events from happening.",,,,2973,21,519,808,24.7142857143,513,5.57,1,256,2,134,100,39,39,15,61,1,0,0,1,1
8973,1,"To the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, millions of kids spend countless hours on the computer either talking with friends, playing computergames, or surfing the web. I strongly believe computers are not a benefit to kids. I believe this for several reasons. Foremost, kids spend to much time on the computer. Secondly, computer use is time consuming and can be addicting. Lastly, nature and the great outdoors are amazing, and kids don't get enough of it when they are on the computer. Kids spend to much of their free time on the computer. When kids sit at a desk playing on the computer, they aren't getting any exercise. This promotes childhood obesity. Habits tend to be hard to breaks, so kids who spend all day on the computer and become overweight have good chance of that way for the rest of their life. Also, kids who spend a good deal of time on websites, such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, @MONTH1 meet and become friends with people who they do not know. These unknown people @MONTH1 infact be adults who are looking to meet kids in person and maybe even kidnap them. Computers can consume a good deal of time out of a day. This time could have been better spent outside with friends or reading a book, also etc time on the computer is time that could have been spent with family. Kids who spend all day on the computer also risks losing their social skills. This could prevent them from doing well in school and could keep them from getting a good job in the future. Nature is amazing with all of its natural beauty and offered opportunities. Computers take away from time that could have been spent taking a family walk. Family walks can be an excellent time for family bonding. Walks also provide fresh air, exercise, and time to be in natures beauty. While spending time outdoors, kids have the opportunity to bond with friends by going to swimming or playing pick up sports games. This can also improve athletisism. Computers do more harm to kids than they do good. Kids spend to much time on the computer. Computers also consume much of the time that kids could use to get outside and spend time with family and friends. Lastly, nature is amazing with all of the beauty and opportunity that it offers and computers only take away from this. So, out with computers and in with exercise and time to spend with family and friend!",,,,2328,27,418,595,15.4814814815,415,2.06,0,165,0,131,83,16,27,20,58,0,0,0,0,1
8974,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do you do your daily job? You type your newsletters on the computer! But it doesn't mean that you don't communicate or go outside and exercise. As a matter-of-fact, computers can help your socializing skills, help you learn about the world around you, and they can even help you make a new routine for your daily exercise! As long as you use it safely. Which most people do, computers are a fine additon to our society! Some people wouldn't even know about our society or world without a computer. The library isn't open @NUM1 but if you've got a computer you are in luck! Many kids and adults use the computer for research, whether it's for a language arts project on shakespeare or a business report about stocks. The internet has all the information. When done gathering all that knowledge from @ORGANIZATION1 you can graph your results or use a program called powerpoint to make a presentation some graphs might take you hours to draw, but this is fast and easy. Scientist use these program as well to make models, and help us understand something that might be too smalll or too big. Not only scientists, but many other jobs require computer knowledge. In this day and age, if you do not know @CAPS2 to open your e-mail, you might have problems reaching other people because everyone uses computers. Computers help you socialize in so many ways. With family and friends! For example, half of my family lives in @LOCATION1 and I always use the computer to communicate because calling all the time costs a lot of money. You can even set up a skype account where you can see the other person and they can see you through a webcam. I use this talk to my sister and dad all the time, and it's free! I sometimes talk to my friends, too. We can plan things for the weekend this way. Not everyone who uses a computer uses it all day. Besides, you ran out fo things to do somethims. If you have a laptop you can even bring your computer outside and enjoy the fresh air. If you wanted to exersise outside as well, you could find an exersising routine that can help you stay for. Maybe, you can search a healthy meal something new for dinner. If you wanted to go to your friends' for dinner you could mapquest their address and save some time because you would know where to go. No matter what it is, the computer can help you with it, and is a great tool to have! But always be careful about what you post or what you see becasue not everything could be true!",,,,2474,29,462,649,15.9310344828,452,2.06,1,206,1,112,86,23,28,25,45,1,0,0,1,1
8972,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, technology has increased sufficiently and more than @NUM1's of the country spends half of their day on the computer. Too much time is spent online and people should step away froim the electronic device and spend more time doing more time consuming things when you chat online you put your safety at risk. Not only that, but you are so interested by whats on the screen that you forget to manage your time and spend less time exercising and with friends or family . Computers are big distraction and they stop people from taking care of their responsibilities. By chatting with others and putting things online, you don't know who's watching or looking at it. If you talk to someone you are not fimiliar with you could be putting yourself at risk. In addition, you never know who's on the other side of the computer screen. It could be a @NUM2 year old man telling you he's @NUM3, or it @MONTH1 be a sex offender. Today, half of the country spends their time talking to others on the computer. People are not very careful about what they say or do on the internet and you could something that in the long run will be harmful to you or somebody else. Also, because our technology has become so advanced, people just sit around and forget about exercising and the world we have outside. Computers are one of the many things that contribute to @LOCATION1 is @CAPS1 problem. This issue is not something our nation should be proud of. Supplys of computers should be limited and people should on enjoying the outdoors and exercising. Because there are so many things you on them. I think that contributes to the problem as well. I think that computers are increasing @CAPS1 rates and that there should be something done to get adults and kids back outside enjoying nature. In addition to these two arguments, computers also distract people from spending time with friends and family. Talking to a family member online is not the same as being with them in real life. Technitions think that they have it all figured out, but they don't. Computers are normal to the wellbeing of people and their social/emotional lives. John white, a medical doctor at @ORGANIZATION2 says' The technology level @ORGANIZATION1 is so high that people just sit at their desks all day and stay on the computer. Studies have recently shown that @NUM4 out of every @NUM5 people will develope some type of depression if all they do is stare at a screen half of the day. To conclude, computers have been shown to be a distraction to the human population. An even play person can put their life at risk by puting things online and chatting with people they do not know. Secondly, computers contribute to the issue of @CAPS1 and distract people fom going outside and exercising. Lastly. this technological device gets in the way of real communication with friends and family, can up to depression, and can hurt someone's wel-being or social /emotional life. Way too much amounts of time are spent online and should be spent doing more time consuming things, some @MONTH1 say that computers can increase people's social lives, but it won't because a person you could be talking to can not even be a real person and many forget about the real world outside on the internet.",,,,3257,29,578,848,19.9310344828,567,3.62,1,227,2,171,104,31,36,33,77,0,0,0,0,0

8977,1,"I feel that the effects computers have on people are all in good nature and they don't infringe on phisical activities very much. First, the benefits of technology in a modern society and second why computers do not impact physical and social activities to any degree of harm. First, people use computers all the time. At home at work, and in school. Technology is all around us, without it we would not be able to function as we do today. Transit would be affected not having commuter subways would put more people on the streets getting to work or a different job because without that comuter train work is to far away for them to be able to afford to drive to. Also computers take care of things such as the power grid keeping it balanced so that every place around the country gets the needed electricity for its homes, factories, and bussiness. It also controls things such as water systems around the town keeping all the from being put under to much pressure. Computers also have a plesure side to them. They allow people to communicate, express play games, and many other things like get news or watch a tv show they misses. The things is when one of the computers or a server or any of the modern technology fails it leaves people with a handicap. Not being able to do or have some thing like electricity or water takes them out from the rest of the world back when a fire was the only thing for heat, and water care from the stream. Second most people know the limits of usage for modern technology, knowing when it is time to take a break and do some outside activities, play with friends, or go on an outdoor vacation with the family so that they are not just stuck on a computer. The impact that computers have on physical strength are little to none, and in no way impare anyone who knows and has the common sense to say "" I have been on this computer long enough and it is time i do something other than sit around.""

If you needed to ask a friend a question about homework or what you are doing later and you know they have a @CAPS2, aim, myspace or something like that instead of calling them ya can talk to them on the computer. If you have family in another state and it pays extra to call them you can talk to them online. That is why it's good to be able to talk to friends and family online. Lastly, schools are evolving and putting the books online so student want have to take them home. Also so the schools want have to pay for all the books they have to buy.

If i could ban computers i think I would. by the looks of it I can tell the electricity bill is like sky high. That's because @CAPS2 spend so much time on the computer. If we spent the same smount of time exercising that we do on the computer I bet the obessity rate would decrease big time.

The @CAPS4 thing you notice two hours then passed by. It's easy to just say I'm not going to exercise today instead I'm going to just get on the computer. It's even harder trying to walk up the stairs without taken a break or wheezing. Meeting new people, I will have to admit is a pleasure. Constantly going on the computer every half an har just chatt with people who you don't know that isn't good. That is what also causes no exercise. Americans get so caught up in ""facebook"" and ""myspace"" they forget what's really important. Family, going outside getting some fresh-air that's important.

For example my cousin has a disibility with hand eye cordination and computers let her interact with the program, @NUM1 experts say that computers help kids with disabilitys alot.

Also @PERCENT1 of kids this day and age are good on the computers so it make it easy for them to do research. Lastly, the internet and computers let you connect with family and other people online. Now I know that @ORGANIZATION1 is some bad people on the internet but if you use it right thats not a problem. Just like my cousin and me he lives in @LOCATION1 so we use @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to keep in touch with each other.

Pollution is also a problem due to the factories. You also never know what could happen with new inventions. Addiction, pollution and uknown dangers of technology all show reasons on why we shouldn't advance in technology. Computers, videogames, phones, and @CAPS3 other addicting stuff can become a huge problem for some. According to a google web poll the side that said my child is addicted to video games had a higher percentage over the poll that said its not a big deal its not like its killing us. But really all this technology is killing us. Slowly but surely on the other hand though its happening more quickly when someone doesn't stop playing the become addicted and stop doing their regular activities therefore moving them not exercise and become obese. This technology advancement is not necessary. Even our own president, quoted to the @CAPS1 times saying that ""@CAPS2 are merely having a race that never ends with other countries. And on their road to so called victory they bring us nearer and nearer to defeat."" @CAPS3 interpret the quote to say the resources they use the more they kill the earth which leads the human race to defeat.

8986,1,"Dear @PERSON1, Computers are not as great as everyone thinks they are. They have taken away many of the good things in the world and have had a very negative effect on people even if they don't yet realize it. Computers have made us an obese world, have destroyed our connection with nature, and have killed all the creativity that was left in the world. Let's face it people are a lot fatter than they were thirty years ago. Since the invention of the computer people have had more of a drive to sit and stare at it than to get some much needed exercise. Due to this there has been a great increase in the number of obese people. Actually, @NUM1 in @NUM2 @CAPS1 are obese. Also, there has been a great decrease of great athletes. In the figure stating portion of the olympics, @NUM3 out of the @NUM4 skators fell. ""I don't know what's wrong. They never used to fall."" said my mother. The quality of the athletes has gone down because they spend more time at their computers than they do practicing their sport. If people continue to obsess over computers, we will need to make the elevator weight capacity much higher. When was the last time you went for a walk in the woods? Why would you need to when you can just go on the computer and look up a picture of a tree? Computers have destroyed our connection with nature and this has caused many problems with nature. Trees are being cut down and animal's homes are being destroyed, but people don't care. They don't care because they have never seen with their own eyes an animal happy in its natural habitat. Why would they want to go into the woods to look at a dear when they can just look one upon the computer. People say our kids many never be able to see a polor because global warming is melting their homes. Why should we care? We can just show them a picture on the computer after they've all gone extinct. Lastly, computers have killed the last bit of creativity that was left in this world. When I was little I entered in this art competition every year. There were many different medias, but I took pictures. I did fine until the invention of the digital camera and photoshop on computer because people would edit their pictures to make them look better while I entered my picture the way I took it, without the computer's help. Computer's have also taken away the creativity from music. @PERSON2 @CAPS2 has said ""You can't tell me technology makes things sound better. It doesn't. It only makes things easier to use."" Other artists fix their mistakes with computers so it sounds better which is unfair to people like @PERSON2 who sells it the way it comes out of the instruments. Computers have taken away the need to use your brain. In conclusion, computers make people fat, kill nature, and turn people's brain to mush. They are a bad thing and will change life as we know it. It is your choice. Do you want to be a @NUM5 lb person whose never seen a waterfall, but who has one as the wallpaper of your computer and who could never write this paper because they don't know about the creative part of their brain?",,,,3079,37,581,806,15.7027027027,577,2.06,1,254,1,140,125,39,32,13,72,0,0,0,1,0
8987,1,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, the iTouch, and the iPad are all examples of the latest in technology, specifically from @ORGANIZATION2. Such technology can have many effects on people, both good and bad. But, our society @MONTH1 be too caught up in today's advancements. Computers have a negative effect on people. There are many reasons that support this opinion. First, the screens take time away from friends and family. They can also effect one's performance in school and prevent people from getting the exercise they need. @CAPS8, computers can negatively effect people. To begin, computers have a negative effect on people because they take time away from friends and family. For example, I got a new laptop for @CAPS2. I loved it so much that I spent all of my time on it. Usually after spending too hours on @CAPS3, and @PERSON1, he had to tell me to get off. He was angry with me for this. Another example is when my family scheduled to go see a movie together. The movie was called The @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and was supposed to be astonishing. But, I didn't want to go because I was too busy watching television on @CAPS3. My computer was too addicting to leave to spend time with my family. Also, there was one instance when my family had gone over to anothers house. My friends and I went straight to the computer playing on @LOCATION1 and losing the thoughts of playing @CAPS7 or exploring the woods. Their mother had to scold us and say ""This is a computer-free playdate. Get off."" @CAPS8, these examples show that computers can take time away from the people that matter most to us. Another reason why computers have a negative affect on people is because of school work. For example, my sister is in fourth grade, so she doesn't have much homework. But even an hour's worth of math and writing frustrates her so she goes on @PERSON1 @PERSON1 instead of completing it. She spends at least half of an hour playing on the site until my mom tells her to finish her work. Another example is how I used to watch @CAPS9 shows on my laptop at night rather than getting sleep. I watched at least two @CAPS10 Family episodes in bed after my family had all said good-night. I wasted about an hour of valuable sleep on my computer, making myself really exhausted at school the next day. Another example of how computers have a negative effect on school is how it changed my reading habits. Since I learned to read, I have been putting aside @NUM1 minutes to an hour of reading each day. I would read before I went to bed at night. But now, I spend time on my laptop. I have lost my love of reading to computers. @CAPS8, they have negative effects on people. A final example of why computers have a negative effect is because of the noticable lack of exercise. For instance, one out of three children in @LOCATION2 are overweight or obese. This is partly due to the fact that nobody goes outside to play like they used to; they play on the computer instead. Also, I want to begin to exercise as well. But, I find that playing on the computer is more enjoyable than push-ups and sit-ups. My dad additionally is affected as opposed to going on a bike ride, he goes on @CAPS11. Computers obviously have a negative effect on people's exercise habits. People must decide their opinion on computers now or never. Computers have a negative effect on people. I have traded my love for reading and school for computers. People are trading exercise for computers. They are trading family and friends for computers. We must decide bad act now in order to save society from getting lost in the world of computers.",,,,3605,48,650,969,13.5416666667,641,1.28,1,261,1,188,122,35,36,22,93,4,0,1,0,0
8990,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 has been some on going conflict on whether computers acually help you or not. Well the answer, to me, is clear computers are not helpful to your health. You don't always know who it is your talking to, it doesn't give any physical help, and tends to make people lazy as well as people just use it to make good time. Useing the computer takes @CAPS15 from your time in the real world. Instead of sitting @CAPS3 looking at pictures of a forest, go outside and go for a hike in one or @CAPS4 up your money from babysitting or washing cars, and go to the one you were looking for. ""@CAPS5 sitting in front of the computer all the time @CAPS9 are becoming lazy. This one factor has contributed greatly to the obesity of @LOCATION2."" @CAPS6 @PERSON1, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, and formal gym teacher, at conference discussing the health and society of @LOCATION2. @PERSON1 @PERSON1 is right with people spending less time on the computer they are spending less time exercising even beleve it or not it states that computers are in the top five reason of @CAPS9 are becoming over weight.

Online bulling is the number @NUM1 cause of suiside. And talking to people online creats bad relationships. So instead pick up a book and read about someone or somewhere. It's better for your brain and poor health. Overall you can see my opinion is very clear computers are bad for your health not only because @CAPS3 are a cause of dissapeernces, deaths, bad relationships and obesity, but because it is way more fun to go out and skydive instead of watching it on the internet.

8993,1,"My opinion about people using computers is that they shouldn't be using all the time. I think that if people spend more time on a computer that they're going to forget about doin things for in reality. Sure you can meet people online or playing sporting games, but that doesn't have to stop you by doing it for real in reality. Half of the things that you can do on the computer you can do it for real. It's really important to go outside and play excersice etc. Another reason why people shouldn't be stuck on the computer all the time is that people should have time with their family or friends. Example: @CAPS1 say that one of your friends wanted to go bowling with you and you had nothing to do but either go on the computer or go with your friend. You should get out and have fun, instead of rotting your brain behind a computer when you can go out and try to make more differences in life. Try to do something interested in, like sports and jobs. I think its very important to do things in reality instead of viturally. It's also dangerous to alot of people, who go online can files. They try to act like they're little kids, and trick people to meet at some random place and do horrible things to them. People need to be alert when it comes to chatting with strangers online like on myspace, facebook, espin etc. The internet is dangerous.

8991,1,"How often do you use your computer or laptop? I use mine constantly and i believe that computers do not have negative effects. They provide entertainment, communication, and learning opportunities. As i mentioned, computers can provide an imense amount of entertainment. Many people like playing games. For example, my friend @PERSON2 enjoys playing a wide variety of games sach as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. Not only are games entertaining, but they can help develop a hand-eye coordination. In addition to gaming, there is music. A recent survey says that up to @PERCENT1 of people listen to or download music onto an ipod or @NUM1 player. Videos are also a great entertainment feature on computers. I remember last @DATE1 when my friend and i watched a video called ""The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5"" created by my cousins. We were so hard that we were on the ground for five minutes. Entertainment is one of the many positive effects that computers have. Computers also provide communication to other people. Social networking sites are ways people communicate through computers. My cousin showed me his facebook page and i how it connects people. Friends can write what they are doing and you can comment on it, you can do a chat with one other person and just talk, or you could create a message and have many people talk. Another way computers help communication is through e-mails. Some people use the for business and some for pleasure. I remember when my father took me to work and i watched him filter through his hundres of e-mails people all around the world. Also, people can perform video calls. I understand if you say that you could just talk to them in person, but it is still a great thing if you can not get to that person and they have a computer or laptop. Communication is a positive effet of computers. Finally computers can just help you learn about different things. Do you want to learn about a place before you go there or are you just going to pick at random? I think i would do some reasearch on my computer. The internet can have thousands of databases of information about places all over the world. My computer teacher @PERSON1 says, ""computers can have information about almost anything as long as you know what you want."" @CAPS6 faraway places, there can be information on people from around the world.

8992,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, ""@PERCENT4 of deaths are from people talking online to another person they don't know and telling them about themselves."" Are computers benefitting society? I don't think computers benefit society because people aren't talking to the people, people spend to much time staring at their screens and people are learning wrong information wen googling something. There as been a @PERCENT1 increase from @DATE1 to @DATE2 in people using computers. Think about today. First, computers donnot benefit society because people are not talking to the actual person. There are two main reasons why this is bad. People are not learning social skills. When going to a job interview, you need to know how to act and what to say. You have little time to respond. When you @CAPS3, you can take as much time as wanted to think about the appriatte wwe of the words. Also @PERCENT2 of students, think it is easy to talk to their boyfriend/girlfriend. When they are older they need to in person to the. A @PERCENT4 increase @NUM1 years ago, the increase was in cyber. Also chatting online is bad because I don't always know you are talking to. Somebody could say they are a @NUM2 year old who likes everything you like. But they could be a @NUM3 year old man that kills girls that age a living. Also you don't always know who is reading what you are saying.you might put something on your walll that could offend some. You didn't even. The second reason I disagree with computers I think computers are helping the world. their eyes and making their brain turn to mash and they don't even realize it. Warcraft, you will need to know other things. The third reason computers are affecting society is because people are not getting accurate information. There are two reasons this is bad, the first, you cannot always tell if a website is acccurate. ""@CAPS4 it have accurate information?"" is always the big question.When people are ""learing"" about foreign people places, and things, they are learning wrong. Also, we are loosing the right way to look up information. Nowadays people say, ""o just @CAPS5 it."" People should use the traditional way. Look it up in a book. You can always trust information coming from a book. Computers are teaching bad habbits to kids. @PERCENT3 of schools in america have switched from have information at fingertips to saying ""@CAPS5 first"" then if the and it they find the book. All in all, computers are not benefitting society, they are tearing it apart. People are not talking to the actual person face to face, people are spending to much time staring at their computer screen and people are getting wrong information and bad habbits when going on computers.

I understand adults have jobs that are on the computer all the time for @CAPS2 reasons to be sucessful at what they do. But later on going home after a rough days. They just wana go home on facebook and talk to their friends, family, etc.... which is not @CAPS2 and really effects themselves and their mind in a bad way. That is why there are cell phones, why not just use those to call but after a hard day at work you really should take a nap and eat something healthy to boost up that energy again. If you have a job that priors you to be on a computer all day, when you get home you really should not abuse your privlages and go on it is not healthy if you have kids just take care of them they need you the most. Third of all everyone should have a sport to play or chores to accomplish in their lifes everyday or on the weekends. Why? Because if you dont enforce your kids to do something in their lives or exercise and play sports its not going to have a good oucome. Thats when theres boy/girl drama, more health problems and obisitey rates go up. They became bored nothing to do and the computer becomes their main priority and nothing else matters to them. Now you know all @CAPS1 opinions and details supporting @CAPS1 thoughts and take a look over them, tell me what you think can we overcome or health issues and main prioritys in this world do what is best.

That is because you can resarch information, write to your faraway friends and family, and look up places to fined. Lets talk about resarching infromation on the computers. Lots of people want to fined out suff that they want to know or learn. I used the computer to resarch about jet-fighters because I want learn more about jets to be ready when I go to the millatary. Most people use the computers to resarch imformation. I seen that on the news before it said that @NUM1 out @NUM2 people use the computers to resarch. Lets go on to another good thing that computer. When people are not resarching information they are write emails to the friends and family. I do that alot because most my family live faraway from I can visit them.

9003,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers are benefit to people. They teach you a lot of information about topics you knew nothing about. People need computers in their life to help them. I will tell you why right now. One reason is that we learn about then in school to help us when we get older. For example, in sixth grade we learned how to position our hands on the computer to type faster. I found his very helpful because it does not take me as long to type school papers. In eight grade I am taking computer science to learn about @ORGANIZATION1 and how to make a business portfollio. This will help society because we young people will help corpasations handle their business better, which means less stress on other people. Also, if I wanted to find a job you need to know how to work on a computer because most office jobs require you to have computer knowledge. Learning about computers in school will help the society. Another reason we use computers is to research things about ohter countries for projects. For example, I had to find out how many @CAPS1 soldiers were out numbered by the @CAPS2 in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4. The @CAPS2 outnumbered the @CAPS6 by a lot. Also, my brother had to do a project about the @LOCATION2 states. On the internet he looked up famous places and he also got the places address. My next, reason is that you can learn a lot about people's cultures from far away countries. I find it pretty neat when you find some great facts about countries you don't really knkow much about. Now you can see that researching on a computer can tell you a lot of information. My last reason is that you can talk to you friends. For example, one of my friends moved to @LOCATION3. As you can tell @LOCATION3 is very far from @LOCATION1. Since, we both have a facebook, we could catch up with each other once in a while. You don't need to spend a long time on the computer, just ten to twenty minutes. Also at work, if you email a person who works on a different floor, communicating will be easier and faster. As you can see, talking to people on a computer for a little bit can be helpful, easier, and faster. Computers can benefit a society because of learning about them in school, for research, and to communicate with a friend or employee.

For example, they help students w/ homework in more ways than one, people can communicate to loved ones that are far away from home. And they track hand-eye coordination. As you can see, i think that computers are a great contribution to our society. However, on the other hand, some people find that they take up too much of our lives. Yes, in some cases that @MONTH1 be true, but there are fixes to this problem. First, i would like to tell you about how helpul computers & internet are to students lives. Imagine how hard it would be to do a report or research w/out the use of a computer. Yes, people have managed to do it in the past, but technology has come a long way and using a computer maker things easier. To collage, for instance, you would struggel just to barely w/out a laptop. It holds as many documents as you new it to hold. It's quick & convienent. And, you can get bads of information anything in the blink of an eye. Computers help w/ group project well. You can instant message, one person in your group about topic @NUM1 then ask the other if he thinks the summary on the chapter is too too. Also you can email your teacher the mean, much easier could it. Secondly, there are prove that think computers take up too much our generations lives. In some cases, I agree. but in my opinion that could be the parents for diciplining them m/ a time limit. At my house, we get a certain amount of time on the computer, then we have to get off. Also have ""family bounding"" time where we all sit down & watch @CAPS1.V (@CAPS2 @CAPS3) or a family. And with sports being large fortal lives they get enough exercise & outside time. So as you can see, computers really don'@CAPS1 take over pimples lives. Lastly, kids & teens & even adults have grown used to able to rely on computers to help them, & keep them occupied when their bored. sure some people might cause this terrific discovry but most people just enjoy it. A surveyed @NUM2 out if @NUM3 people that they would not be able to function, without the help of their laptop or computer. now if that number doesn'@CAPS1 make you want to agree with me then not much will. In conclusion, the use of computers @MONTH1 a very positive effect on people. My reasoning for this one it help with school, & its a big part of this generation.

It has different gadgets on it that can make you be able to communicate with people around the world! Computers can also help you learn new facts and abilities. Plus, when you're bored you can play different games or go on different websites. To me, that sounds like it benefits the society pretty well. First off, on computers there's websites or system's you can download into your computer that make you able to communicate with people around the world! One example of a website is facebook. At least @PERCENT1 of people on earth have a facebook. On that website you able to chat and blog with your other friends. My dad had our whole family make are and now, even if they're in another state, I can chat with them everyday! One download that you put on your computer and oovoo. This application makes it like your talking to someone face to face! You can see them right through your computer. Isn't tha cool? Another neat thing a computer can teach you is on subject or things you never knew. A search engine that for you is @ORGANIZATION1. For every person that has a computer @PERCENT2 of people use that search engine to help them learn things they never know. That's alot of people! Don't you think that helps millions of people daily? Finally, computers can make you have fun when you're bored. Most kids don't even complain to their parents when they're bored because the computer makes them busy. Even parent, @PERSON1. Says, ""@CAPS1 so nice for it to be quiet around the house. I can finally have some time to myself with no complaining!"" That sounds to me like that deffinitly benefits parents. To rap this whole letter up, I'd like to say that computers do benefit the society. They help you communicate with other people, help you learn facts you never knew, and they keep you busy-you're never bored!

They make school-work easier and quicker, they let you interact with your friends and they give great ideas on how you can throw a party, spend your day, ect. Let me elaberate on why I think computers deffinately benifit our society. Do you like spending hours looking through a @NUM1 paged book to find something when it can take @NUM2 minutes on a computer? I think we both agree that the answer is no. Computers have been so helpful to has with all of the information it has to make school work much easier. Also, instead of writing a paper where you spell things wrong are crossed and the paper is sloppy, wouldn't you rather have a flawless typed paper from your computer? I know I would. Computer have been a great help to kids everywhere so that's one reason they're great to have. Secondly you can chat with your friends and family on-line. Instead of using minutes on your phone, chat for free on aim, aol, facebook, yahoo, etc. It's also a great way to talk to family that you haven't seen in a while. You can make plans with your friends on-line, and so much more. A survey at my school said that @PERCENT1 of the people there enjoy using on-line chats. The other @PERCENT2 said they didn't or they didn't answer the survey. So, thats another reason why I think computers are helpful. Lastly, many people don't like the idea of being on a computer but you can use it to get fun ideas to do out-side. This way, your computer will help you and you'll get excersise. My friend and I always use the computer to get fun out-door activities in the @DATE1. It has fun things to do in the pool, with or just with each other. It could give good ideas for what to do when you're bored ar party ideas like balloon toss or paper-mashce. That's how the computer can get you out and active.

Doctors use computers to study x-rays and to anlyse someones medical conditions. Say you, the @CAPS1 of the news papper got a concussion while riding your bike. When you go to the doctor the first thing he will have you do is take a impact test. This computer test anylises your concussion and gives useful information to your doctors to help you.

9007,1,"Well, in my opinion I feel that computers have a negative effect on our society. I feel this way for many reasons; @CAPS1 three important reasons would be the following. First, most kids spend more time on computers then they do on homework which messes up their focus in school. Next, computers stop children from going to play outside and getting excercise which effects their health. Last but not least, I feel that computers stop kids from enjoying their family and friends and people around them who care. The first issue i will be discussing will be how computers take the time away from children who should be doing homework or reading a book. Children all over come home from school and the first thing they do is hop on the computer and usually spend hours doing nothing. By them doing that they do not complete their homework which effects their knowledge in school. If children did not have computers it would be easier for them to pick up a book and focus on their school work. My next reason that i will be adressing is how computers stop kids from getting the proper exercise daily and it stops them from getting fresh air and thats bad for their health. Before everyone in the economy had enough money for computers and laptops students would come home and play outside and get involved in sports but now all kids want to do is go on the computer and go on game websites and facebook which is horrible for their health without computers kids can stay in shape and live a healthy life. The last issue that i will be informing you about is how computers stop kids from spending time with their family and friends and spending more time on the computer. Children go to school everyday and most parents work when everyone finally gets home all kids want to do is go on the computers and even parents to. If children are always on the computer then it takes away from the time they can be spending with their loved ones. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that spend time with their family tend to do better in school and in life. With computers the percentage will go down. As you can see computers take away from all the good things in life. If there were not computers students can focus more on their work, they can get more exercise. and they can spend more time with the people they love.

9006,1,"Dear local Newspaper I think that our current advances in technology do not benifit society. I think if people spend less time on the computers then they will live better lives. If they chose to spend time with family, get involved in aports, and spend time with friends instead of using a computer they would live happier lives. The first reason people should not spend to much time on the computer is because you could be spending time with family. It's important to spend a lot of quality time with family because they won't be aorund forever. But if you are always on the computer then your family @MONTH1 think you are ignoring them or just don't want to spend time with them. For example your grandparents want to spend time with you and you just ignore them because you are to busy on the computer. This will most likely make your grandparents very sad and it could hurt their feeling. They will feel this way because you might meen the world to your grandparents but since you won't get of fthe computer they will feel like you don't care about them. Instead of spending time on the computer make time to get together with family this will definatly benefit you in the long run. Another reason society needs to spend less time on the computer is because you could be involved in a sport and be getting exercise. I strongly believe in getting involved in sports instead of sitting in front of the computer is whar must people need to stay healthy. If you are in front of the computer all day then you won't get exercise and you will be very out of shape. It's very important to live a longer healthier life. Everyone has to get exercise, but nobody needs to be on the computer all day. It's your choice weather or not to get involved in sports but in involved in sports and I love my life. Last but not least spending time with friends is very important. I meen its ok to talk to friends online sometimes but most of the time you should go hang out somewhere like go bowling or go to each others houses. I think talking to a friend in person is a lot more meeningful than talking online. Some friendships can get damaged by talking online all the time because its always important to hang out with people in person. An example of this is when my friend always talked to another one of any friends online and they are no longer to much you don't feel like you know them as well anymore and it feels like you only can't cely on your technology to be able to talk to friends because it can't help it can only hurt your friendship.

9014,1,"Dear @CAPS1 I recently read in the local newspaper about the benefits and disadvantages of computers in our society. Though the computer is a powerful and advanced source of knowledge, I believe that it can be a major distraction. Having a computer around can affect our school students, the health of our society and socializing skills. Computers have become popular in the whole student society, and therefore are causing distractions among the students. This morning I read in the magazine, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 about @PERSON2, a regular high school student. As soon as his parents give him a computer for his birthday he began to use it day and night. He never was able to finish his homework or pay attention in class because of the lack of sleep. @PERSON2's grades dropped from an A+, all the way down to a @CAPS4-. @PERSON2 must now stay back another year in order to catch up in his studies. However, he is not the only student who is affected by computers. Recently a study was conducted by tech-ed expert at @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION1. He asked parents if they could check what their children did after school every day. After analyzing his data, @ORGANIZATION2 found out that once school ended, eighty-four percent of the students immediately logged onto their computer to chat and go on email. The whole grade @CAPS2 for each school district has already dropped significantly. Therefore, having computers around can affect the lives of our students who we depend on to help us advance in the future. Secondly, the whole society spends less time exercising because of computers. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 has put on more than @NUM1 pounds of weight due to the ignorance of exercising and addiction to computers. Our society will become unhealthy if the exessive use of computers continues. For example, an adult, @PERSON1 went on the computer everyday while eating bags of fatty, unhealthy junk foods and not even realizing it. By the time a month had passed he accquired a heart problem and was put in the hospital for over a year. Computers affect the health of our society and distract us from what we really shoud be doing.

For @CAPS3 you can learn about exotic places far away, talk to friends and family, and @CAPS29 also teachs you hand are cordination. So many people love to travel the world, over @PERCENT1 of people take vacations to exotic Places any where under the @CAPS4! Imagine, You're on a @CAPS5 gazing out the window into the @CAPS8 blue sky, and soaring above dozens of @CAPS6 you've never even heard of. When you land, you and your friends get off the @CAPS5 and take a cab to your hotel. There you take a luxurious bath and your anxiety melts away. The next @CAPS25 you go @CAPS7 seing on the island. These is a huge water fall poring into crystal @CAPS8 @CAPS9 water. When you finish your hike up to the top of the water fall you look up @CAPS10, @CAPS11 a @CAPS12 view of the @CAPS13 island. Doesn't that sound like the perfect vacation? Well, You wouldn't even know @CAPS29 existed fit weren't for the reaserch you did on the @CAPS18. I have a friend named @CAPS14, about one or two months ago @CAPS15 moved to @ORGANIZATION1. I rarley ever see her in @CAPS16, but I see her on line. We both have a @CAPS17 cam. in our @CAPS18 we use to talk to each other from different destinations. ""I really @CAPS19 you!"" @CAPS14 would say every time we talk I would say ""I @CAPS19 you too!"" but I'm glad we can talk through @CAPS22! We'd both laugh and smile about the device that was able to let us talk on the @CAPS18. @CAPS29 is nice to see her, and know @CAPS15 misses me... But can you even imagine how much we would @CAPS19 each other if we couldn't go on the @CAPS18? That would be like @CAPS24's @CAPS25 for us! In @CAPS26 we have basket ball, but not every one likes @CAPS27. in fact some people despisee @CAPS27 with a firex passion those people like to sit around at the @CAPS18.

""@CAPS29's alwas good to have skills."" my mom would say. I never knew what @CAPS15 ment. but if you think in your mind about what @CAPS15 means, hand-eye cordination is one of them. What kind of games? on the @CAPS18 they make games that you have to got an object same where at the right time. Your brain thinks and tells your hands what to do. so, there you have hand-eye cordination. So I urge you @PERSON1 to get the glory and magnificence of computers out into the open.

Some people @MONTH1 say that computers do nothing good for any community however, their are people like me who think different. One reason I think computers are good is they provide usful information on the internet, some things they provide is news. if you don't have a computer at home don't worry because they have become so popular that you can one in almost any local librery. Do you have family that lives far from you but you still want to keep in touch? If so then you should get a computer, they have websites provided on the internet that you can use to chat with family and friends from a very long distance so you can keep in touch with anyone. Don't you wish you can check the traffic and weather befor you leave the house? Well you can do that with a computer you can go on websites that provide that kind of information so you can know what kind of traffic your going to be in.

9016,1,"Computers can help people in this century. It can help people with online sites, research papers, and social living. Most agree that computers help find better ways to do things. First, I'll start with online sites. Online, there are many facts to help you with information. You can look up places to see, something that you saw on the, or anything else! Maybe if you to go somewhere, you can look it up to find more about it. I remember @LOCATION1 willing my mom. My mom spent weeks learning about it so we could have more fun there! Also, if you saw a commercial about something say a @LOCATION1 bike, you could go to an online store. At most online stores, you can either buy it online or you can see if the bike is still in stock at the store to your area. Next, computers also help you with research papers. For people with soppy handwriting, they can type their paper at the computer so the paper will look more organized. In my spanish class, a kid with terrible handwriting took his first on my teacher's computer. Computers are also quicker and easier when writing a research paper. No one I know likes spending most of their time writing a paper by hand when they could just get it done faster by typing it. Punctuation are also made with people who write papers. On the, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 checks your mistakes. They also give you on what to you're writing a paper. Last but not least, there is social. Being social plays a big role in our society because it falls under the category of communication. Computers allow you to talk with your friends if you're not with them. Let's say it's a @DATE1 @TIME1. You are sitting. You can go onto the computer and maybe ask your friend to hangout with you. Also, if your a parent who has gone away, you can communicate with then on the computer. Won't it be nice to find out how your child is doing? Lastly, you can share your pictures with other people on computers. Pretend a mom just had a beautiful baby girl. She could share the pictures with her friends on the computer and ask what they think or the precious little baby. Computers are important. They offer online sites, help with social living.

9017,1,"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a worldwide phenomanan today. But do they really benefit mankind? Experts believe that computers have a positive affect on people, one is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. Another benefit is that computers allow people who can't afford to travel, the ability to learn about far away places, computers also provide communication across the globe. But others disagree, they think that people spend too much time on computers and less time interacting with family and friends. I believe that computers are a benefit to people. First, computers teach hand-eye coordination. While playing games a person must be able to look at the screen and not look down at the keyboard or mouse. Another hand-eye coordination example is typing. Anything being typed requires the person to look at the screen and type at the same time, so one must be very good to type fast. Computers are very good for learning about faraway places. Someone who can afford to go to another country or another state is fine. But for people who are disabled or cannot afford the trip will need some way to learn about it. With a computer one @MONTH1 travel somewhere without physiclaly moving, like a book. But unlike books, computers allow the user to watch the news, or research something that has just been changed. Others believe that computer usage lessens the interaction between family and friends. But on the contrary, computers allow the communication between people all over the world. With computers you meet new people everyday, and become friends with new people. Also many believe that when people spend time on the computer that interaction between family members goes down. But this is also wrong, my father and I both have computers. We play games with each other and love to talk about the games. I think that without a computer me and my father would seldom interfact. So obvisouly computers are a benefit to mankind. They teach hand-eye coordination. They also open communication with the world. Finally they allow the ability to research and learn about faraway places.

First of all people who have computers are getting addicted to them. People @CAPS3 not stay fit now and are getting lazy, and fat. Secondly people get hacked alot and are soon chased down by the person who hacked their computer (muderer, hacker, etc...). Lastly because people @CAPS3 not spend time with family. First of all is because people are getting to adicted to them and are not getting enough exercise. People are just sitting in front of their computer, wasting away, getting fat and lazy. Exercise is the most important thing. Without excercise and staying healthy you could get serious health issues. Secondly is because people get hacked. This is partially why we have murders and other people like that in our world. Once they hack your computer there is no stopping them. They will find out where you live, your name, how old you are, your social security numbers, your credit card information, etc. Lastly I would like to say that people are not spending any time with their family. Spending time with your family is more imporant than sitting in front of your computer. Go out @CAPS3 more fun stuff once in a while. @MONTH1 be you might be going on a vacation that you did not even know about because you were spending to much time on your computer.

ThatÕs why I think that @CAPS1 is not to good to be on them more and more. First, of all @CAPS1Õs a health counser. let's start off with people becoming overweight more then ever. I would say that about @PERCENT1 of people how spend a lot of time on the computer are overwieght now in the @NUM1 centery. Just look around and you see a lot of overwieght people. Also, another reason why @CAPS1's a health counser is that people don't move that much when they are at there compters. For example I know I don't want to more a lot or do anything when I'm on the compter. And a lot of other people don't either. That's why @CAPS1 is a big time health counser to people. Secondly, @CAPS1's a safty reason. Why, because @CAPS1's not good to look to long at the compter because @CAPS1 can hurt your eyes. For example I did hurt my eyes that now I have to wear glasses. Also, to many people don't want to exercize afterwards. @PERCENT2 donot exercize after being on the compter for a long time that's why @CAPS1's a safty reason not to be on them to long that a time. Finlly, @CAPS1 causes family problems. Spending to much time on the computer can causes family problem's because you don't see all the time. I know when I would not leave my compter often @CAPS1 caused family problems, cause I did not see them. Also, your family gets mad that you don't see them often. @PERCENT3 of familys say that compter cause family problems. That's why @CAPS1 is a family probem too.

9021,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I strongly believe that we should use computer. We should use computers because it helps you with a lot of things. The first reason why we should use a computer is because a computer can go on anything you want. It can find the place you want to go or other thing you are looking up. Its go to have a computer when you really need it for something important. For example @CAPS3 you can't find a hotel the computer will tell you where it is at, thats the good part about the computer it tells you directions and everything. The second reason why we should have or use a computer is because a computer can help you find a @CAPS2 anywhere. You know how a lot of people are looking for jobs now all they need to do is go on a computer and there a lot of places that are hiring other people. I have a sister that has a @CAPS2 now because she look up on the computer and she found one there. Its important to have a computer. My third reason why we need computer is that we can communicate with others. Its good to communicate others through the computers because you can have more than one person talking to you over the computer. For an example @CAPS3 your on the phone you can talk to one person or @CAPS3 you have a friend that dasent have a phone you can talk to them through the computers. I know a lot of people through the computers they said its better. My last reason why we should have computers because computers can help you with your homework. Its good when a computer helps you with your homework because @CAPS3 you dont know how to do it the computer gives you a lot of examples or it just tells you. Like my history teacher he always gives us homework about a person and he tells us to go on the computer and find the person's history and put it in your own word. I think its much easyer to do your homework on the computer. I strongly believe that we should have a computer because a computer can look up everything. It can look up at places you want to go, you can do your homework, and you can find a @CAPS2, and can communicate with your friends and Family.

This is because they both don't have a computer. I aas an adult believe that computer I does not make exercising time less and other. I believe that computer is a great technology. Therefore, computer have positive effect on people. First, computer help people make new friend around the world. If there are no computer than people can not know how different place in the world is like. Computer help people talk with other people and chat about life. If those were no computer than the people will never make new friend. A connection that support this is once I made friend with a girl who live all the way at @LOCATION1. She was a nice, kind hearted person. The girl was my closes friend I ever had. She would cheer me up when I was strugging. Without a computer would never get to know this nice girl. One last reason is, with computer people can tlak to their family if part of their family is far away from then. Hence, computer is a great way to talk or comunicate with each other. Next, computer help us learn about life and the world. If the computer have internet peole could look up things to help them learn. If thses were no computer those fact will never be found out and people will not learn. Also, computer have game that help people practice their learning skill. There are some website taht make @CAPS2 to help people learn. If ther were no computer then, there would out be alot of way to study for a test or a quiz. My children have a computer for themselves. They would use their computer to learn fact play educated games. This improve my children skill because they get better grade then when they have no computer. Thus, I think computer have positive effect on people. Lastly, computer have software that maek life a easies way. For instant, the software, @ORGANIZATION1, help people write essay and other faster by pressing on the keyboard. This does exhaust their hand. Also, their paper would be neat clar. The other software could help people organize ther buiness and calculate their cash for instant. People use computer mostly for educated reason, and for their buiness. As you can see, computer mostly have a positive effect on people. Finally these are all the reason why computer have a good effect on people. I have told you about how people can comunicate with each other, people could use computer for education, and people can use software on the computer to make life easier. These reason support my opinion because all of these reason help people life in some way. People need thing to help them have a better life and improve their education.

Many teens use websites like myspace or facebook for chating on these websites you can also post pictures and snow people how your feelings anf style. This is good for parents because since their kid will be talking on computer they wont run up their phone bill. Also you can play games online for free.

Finally computers teach hand-eye coordination! Video chatting, iming, audio chatting ect. These are jsut some of the many ways that computers give you a boost up in comunicating with your family and friends, while still enjoying @CAPS1 face, or voice! Video chatting is on many or most of the laptops, and desktops that people own. Video chatting lets you, and a friend/ faimly member to talk to each other by the computer while seeing and hearing them. Its a great way to communicate with people that don't live so close to you. IMing is when two or more people can instant messaging each other. This is handy for when you don't want to call someone but just have a quick question to ask a friend. Audio chatting is who a phone call but on you computer. So if your ever without a phone you can go on your computer and call someone, using the phonebook thats also on your computer! These are alleasy free ways to communicate with your friends, and family when they are not always right @CAPS1 to talk to of to hangout with. With computers you can bring the nature indoors! With our technology word getting so big its easy for people to own laptop. With laptops you can go every where and still be able to go on the computer! So you could go out to the beautiful park sit down and go on your computer enjoing nature and using the computer. If you wanted to go on vacation to the @CAPS2 you would go on your computer and book your trip. This way you would use a computer to get a vacation to the wondered outdoors! While your at the @CAPS2 you would probably want to take lots of pictures of all the amazing things you see, so then what do you do if you want to show all this amazing pictures to your family just upload the pics on to your ocmputer and email them to as many people as you want all around the world! So with computers you really can bring the nature to you! Even though you @MONTH1 not believe this computers teach hand eye coordination. This can help and translate the many other activities that people do. One example is driving. without hand eye coordination you would be in a real pickle leave you need to control the wheel and look where your going so its good that computers double your skill.

Those whose supports advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people ability to learn, and allow online communication. In my opinion, computers are a benefit to our society. As I've mentioned, computers teach hand-eye coordination. You would go through life easilly if you have hand eye coordination. For instance, you would be able to type a paper two times faster than usual, since, your not flipping back and forth to look at your paper and type. You would be look at your paper, but typing at the same time. Also, using a computer to use games are also benefits. Last @MONTH1 I had your suppose to look at the screen while you press arrow keys on your keyboard. Another benefit would be that you would be able to multi task. As you progress in life you would have more responsibilities and task you need to accomplish, so knowing how to multitask is an excellent strategy computers would benefits you now and the future. Next, computer would give people the ability to learn and educate themselves. In @PERSON1 class, he always tells about the @PERSON2 speech or the earthquake in @LOCATION2. Students would be interested, so they o home to research the @PERSON2 speech. Not only that, students can went to travel to. In scope @CAPS1, they stated, ""@PERCENT1 of families dont know how children use computers for home work. they go online and check. By checking, the student wouldnt have a gigantic lecture writing for them if there is no left then the student, teacher, and parents would be happy. Everyone might think computer are distraction, but they could help learn/ educate you. Finally, computers would allow you to talk or chat online. Computer chatting could save parents money.If you have a friend in @LOCATION3 or @LOCATION4, it would cost a tremendous amount of money on phone bills to talk to them, but you can chat on facebook with no cost at all. Second you might think that teens are from family, they could be a family member all the way across the globe. I have an aunt in @LOCATION1 and you can talk to friends without getting in trouble.

You can't move around if you are playing games all day and night. Excercise is very important and @CAPS2 one should get their fix if it.

Also if you have little kids and you don't trust childcare you can take care of them at home while your working in the computer. Or even when you are sick and you just want to sit down in your bed you can still work with your computer. Those are @CAPS1 reason why I think working at home with computer is a good idea and its makes people happy. @CAPS1 second reason is that students can do projects instead of writing it by hand.

Do your cousins, the @CAPS2, live in @LOCATION1 state? Mine do, and the way my family communicate with them is by sending emails. Email is also a fun and easy way for friends to communicate. Emailing is also a more casual way to communicate with people. For @CAPS1 guys, calling a girl's house can 'be very intimidating. Communicating to her through email is a fun and simple way to talk to girls without them thinking you like them. My friend @PERSON2 email's the girl he likes all the time and says ""@CAPS3 is fun, and @CAPS3 is not as, never racking as if I had to call her."" @CAPS4 benefit of uding computers is that there is endless knowledge on the internet. Computers can help you learn from all around the world. My sister @PERSON1 is a softmore in college, but the problem is that the college she learns is texas @ORGANIZATION1. @CAPS3 would be to difficult to have her live on campus because @CAPS3 is far away.

Computers help @LOCATION1 keep in contact with relatives or friends that live far away. And you can learn a lot of important information about some places that might interest you. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of people have computers in the @LOCATION1? Please read on for information on why I think computers help our society. You can easily waste extra time you have with playing a game on the computer. First, some people have jobs that are based on working on computers. Some people fix computers, some people make them, and others work on computers. If we didn't have computers, many people would be put out of a job. You have to have a lot of knowledge about computers to work with them. Would you want people to let this skill go to waste instead of helping others in our society? I know that I would not. People should be able to show others how talented they are. Secondly, many people have friends or family that live away. Computers are a way to help them keep in touch. Talking on the phone with someone who lives far away can cost money. But on the computer you can talk to them and do other things. You can keep in touch with them on the computer using @CAPS1 @CAPS2, e-mail, facebook, or another social networking sites. There is another way that you can talk to them over the computer and this is with a webcam you both need it for it to work but this way you can even see them while talking to them. And my final reason, you can use the computer to do research. You might have to do research for a class or your job, either way if you have a computer this could be made very easy. If you have to look up something like a ship, then you probably will find that somewhere on the web. Anything from a dog breed to a war, chances are pretty high that you will find it. In the library you have to search through tons of book to find the information. But go on a computer and there you will find it. Also, computers can help you with a bibliography. You can go to websites like easybib.com, type in your information, hit save, and your done! As you can see there are many ways that computers help our society. I can see where you're coming from when you say they don't but just look at all the ways they do. I hope taht you could now take the good with the bad reasons.

Also, if you want to learn about a far away place then you can learn more about it. Computers even give you avilibility to talk with your friends for free. For starters, computers are an extreme tool for children in school. Many kids like to use a computer because its faster than looking for information in a book. Therefore, this will help students in school get better grades. Its important that we keep recognize. That computers are really important. Our computer teacher @PERSON1 tells us ""@NUM1 kids who is computers get better report cards."" Computers are extremly important for children in school but on the other hand its also a great way to find far away locations. To start, haven't you wanted to go on a cruise and want to find the best one? If you have a computer you can find anything you seach. Its great to find the place you are intrested in and wanna visit. For example, i wanted to visit @LOCATION1 so i searched it and i clicked what website i thought was the best. The computer brings to you information fast. Computers help you in many was like finding vaction spots but also a computer lets you chat with friends. The computer lets you chat with friends over the internet. There are safe websites that let download instant messaging. For example, @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2. This is also important for buisnesses, schools, and parents. This is a great way for a big buisness to communicate with each other throughtout the building or parents to talk to each other and there friends. As the gunder of computer said ""I tried to create a safe way to get fast results."" To sum up communicating is important but some people argue people use it to much. Some representives argue that people are spending to much time on computers and not exercising. You should only use a computer for a certain ammount of time and try to maintain exercise throught the day. Spending to much time on the computer is un healthy so try to have time to fit exercise in. Its important that you keep yourself healthy and fit. In conclusion, computers are important for just about everybody. Computers help you find information, vacations, communicate over the internet.

Social websites help millions a year with social skills. As a matter of fact computers (most computers) have games where people can chat, socialize, and play games.

Exercise is one of the most important things to do. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 population is over weight, dosent have a healthy diet and probably having heart problems. One of the causes to that is being on the computer because when your on the computer you don't want to leave, so in that case you will get some finger foods and snaks. Also wen your always on the computer, your so into the games and web that you dont go out side and get some exerise, with some of your close friends. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of adults and teenagers that have computers never leave their room? Well now you know and this is causing some family online they never get family or friend time. Due to that children think their parents love the computer more than them and parents think their kid is anti-social. Also because of computers you lose some of your close friends and family either because of rumors or negect, and its just not worth it. Wouldn't rather be outside having fun? When your inside your house on the computer you never get to enjoy nature and see all its good qualities. If the computers weren't so hi-tech then people would be able to go camping, hiking or the beach. Just think if we didn't have computers you know how many people will be outside enjoying the world instead or trashing it. Not enough people are having fun outside because their brains and eyes are glued to the computer screen. Also if there was no computers people wouldn't be so lazy and actually save alot of sickness. Well those are my three reasons why I think too many people are on their computers. I hope that you really take a look.

I think people should limt there time on the comeputer. I think people should send a little amount of time on the comeputer. Then so excrise becuase spending too much pn the comeputer is bad. When people spend all thier time on the computer they start to not play with friends, or do things with their famly. They hang out in their room all day and all night. They would eat upstairs. They wouldnt psend anytime with thier famly. Spending time with your famly is important because you need to be ble to contect with them. Spending all your time in your room isnt good becauser you dont talk to anyone. People who psend too much time on the comeputer losse interest in alot of things. They dont want to paly outside, or do things with there famly. I think comeputers are great. when you need to use them just us them us them for what you need them for.

You could all types of thins with them like: ice skating, going for a run, talking about things, walk around your nieghborhood. Doing things like running is great becuase it clears your head, it takes away a little stress, you get fresh air. all of thses things are great for your mind. People who do those things are in great shape and thier minds dont only think about the comeputer. Their minds are think of more then one thing.

9047,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that technology is taking a negative effect on people. People use su much technology that they are using it almost like a reason to stay inside and stay on their computers. Major problems arise from staying on computers, people spend less time exercising outdoors or in gyms. This problem adds to the people who already neglect exercising. Staying inside on a computer all day and never going to exercise is not at all fun when you think about ti. Are the computors really that fun that you must stay glued to them and that exercising is punishment when you are told to exercise? No! It should never be like that. Nature is ment to be enjoyed... Outside? Sure the internet has some incredible pictures of nature, but nothing, nothing ever compares to being outside and actually the real deal! think of it like a contest, grab a camera and try to get the best picture of nature, but not just one, many pictures, then experience the incredible feeling you get just to see nature with your own two eyes. The world was made the way it is for a reason to enjoy it, the work could have been made like a baran waste land, but it's not, so no complaints should be heard. Friends are ment to be talked to in person, make a plan meet them somewhere and play games Not On The Computers! The ultimate test, with friends see whou can go the longest without using technology, or just interact with your friends. Creating a good relationship with friends is a great way to use less technology for the wellness of the people. Do the right thing, off of the computers, get together and do something that matters in the world and maybe then conflicts will not be about exercise neglecting people.

People who are on the computer all day don't hang out with friends of family, they don't get excersise, they don't even go outside. People need to have fun not just sit around playing on the computer. You @MONTH1 have friends at school, but, what about outside of school. If your sitting in front of the computer all day you can't make any friends. People need a social life. They need to go to the mall, movies, or just hang at a friends house. People from the age @NUM1 are always on the computer talking to their friends. If you want to talk to your friends go to their house and talk to them in person. You need to build up energy.

Even through computers are okay to go time if it kids overweight They need to take a step back, breath and think what they are doing. I as a person love the. Most kids don't go out doors. They need to get away from the computer and go outside for at least an hour a day. The kids who only go outside just to get in a car to go somewhere can't enjoy nature. They should go for a bike ride, or to help them be outside and so they can learn to enjoy nature. Nature is a wonderful thing to enjoy. It is relaxing and releases stress. The computer can't do any of that, people on the computer all day should stop and get a life. I am @PERCENT1 against having kids or anyone on the computer all day long. People who are on the computer are antisocial, overweight, and hate going outside is the time to stop everyone who is on the computer.

I have been useing computers all my life and I have only been benifiting from them. I do my homework faster and my spelling has improved. From my analaze computers are only benifical. All my life I have been using computers. Now I use it for my school work and essays. My handwriting is sloopy and my spelling stinks. The @CAPS3 allows me not to have to write things so people dont have to strain to read my handwriting. Also computers now have spell check.

On my essays instead of having to look through book after book to find things out I can just go on @ORGANIZATION1, yahoo or bing to learn the information I need. As I said there short and all differnt things you can learn on the @CAPS3 you just have to look for them.

Do you know how hard it is going through life without hand-eye coordination? It makes everything harder, even trying your shoes. I strongly feel that computers are a huge help to getting better hand eye coordination. Computers can change a kids (or adults) with poor hand eye coordination life just by typing! Every @DATE1 I go to camp, and the other people live far away from @CAPS1 home. How do we keep in touch? Via @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and e-mail.

Now because of computers I can talk to them a lot (even every day!) and keep up our tight friendship. In school we get a lot of homework and projects that require us to know about far away places and things that we don't know. The internet is a great way to find out information. On the internet theres- a lot of websites that can be used to find a lot of different (and helpful!) information. Overall I really think computers benifit our society because they help with hand-eye coordination, help us keep in touch with family and friends, and help us with research.

One thing you can do on your computer is find out almost anything online. You can ask it questions, find out a food recipe, do work on it for you job, and a whole lot more. The internet is probably the coolest thing about your computer. A laptop comes in handy for people who use there computer a lot and who are on the go. Many computers now have a webcam installed in them or people just go out and buy one there self. They can help you communicate with friends, family members and many other people. I know alot of people are just thinking ""well, why dont you just go and see the persons?"" Some people can't do that because the friend or family member might live far away from you or they might be living outside of the country. Now don't you think video chatting with this person might be easier and much cheeper then going out and spending like @MONEY1 on a plane ticket to go see them?

For example, with computers you can search for things like articles and books that will help you with a story or a report for school. One time i had to do a report on bacteria, so i put salmonella into google. There were thousands of websites to choose from. So i clicked on one and read it. Then i had enough information for my report. Also, to make it even better. I typed it so it would look neat. Computers are also helpful to communicate with other eople. With computers you can write e-mails or talk to them on a chat program. There are millions of people that use chat programs on the computer. You can talk to a cousin in @LOCATION1 or a stranger in @LOCATION2. Anything is possible with computers. Also, i play video games on the computer all the time and chat with new people who i never would have met without a computer. Computers also help with things like vacations. You can see pictures of the hotel or you can book the rooms online. You can even book your flights online. Out of @DATE1 people surveyed they all say that they book their flights online when they go on vacation. Youi're able to look at restaurants near your hotel or maybe beaches too. Personally, i think that is very helpful. Computers are very helpful and very neccessary in todays modern world. That is why i hope you side with me and plenty of other people in the world. P.S.

9048,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I recently found out that you were diciding if computers had a positive or negative effect on people computers are a big distraction towards, adults and especially adolescents. They also seem to more families grow apart. Lastly, teenagers are more nerablen in getting hurt because of the computer. In my opinion I strongly agree that computers have a negative effect on people. Computers cause s distraction to adults and adolescents. Students in their teenage years spend more and more time on the computer that they do focusing on school. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of students get on the computer the moment they get home. This makes students not want to do their homework but instead procroctinate until a later time The more they put it off the less likely they will do it because they are too busy on they computer. This will cause students to fall behind in school and get bad grades because they aren't doing their homework. Not only student but adults also get highly distracted by the computer instead of doing work or a special project for the company that need to be the computer they on are waiting time online talking to friends. This @MONTH1 pose as a threat to their carrer. If they dont finish that project and it comes to the time where they have to present they will be unprepared. This might make it more likely for them to lose their job, and no one can afford to lose their job in this economic struggle and all because of a computer. Also, @MONTH1 adolescents have chores they must follow and if they are spending too much time on the computer it will never get done if it doesn't get done their parent might ground them or take away a possession. The computer is a huge distraction for all kinds of people. Adolescents as they get older become very independent very fast, and it is mostly because of the computer. They want to spend all their free time playing games or talking to friends that they forget about their family. This causes much tension between families because they are never all together to be able to act like a family. This can hurt teenagers in the long run because when they become older and they begin to have a family they won't know how to act towards them if they also turn out to be a child that is always on the computer the entire time. On the other hand when the adults are on the computer all the time being distracted, their children might feed ignored. If they feel ignored than they might not want to attempt to try to have a relationship if they think all their parents care about is the computer. This will make a huge strain in the family bend. When either part of the family becomes distracted by the computer it can cause fights to break out. If a parent tell their child to get off the computer and they don't listen then it @MONTH1 cause a fight between them. This could turn out to affect the child in a bad way because then they will just want to stay on the computer even though their parent disapproves which @MONTH1 lead to theym getting grounded or punished and only because they got distracted for too long on the computer. Teenagers spend much of their time online talking on websites, such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, or @CAPS4 which tend to be the biggest distraction it might seem fine at first but if they begin to talk to people they souldn't they become more vulnerable to getting hurt. By having teenagers talk to strangers on these websites they might get lured into a trap and get hurt. If they decide to meet up with a person that they met over the internet and the stranger chooses to hurt them than the adolescents life can be in leopardy. This stranger could be a predator and the teenager won't even know it until the stranger does something to harm them. A simple distraction of the computer could risk the lives of teenagers and eyppse them to danger without even knowing it.",,,,3867,30,707,996,23.5666666667,698,5.18,1,258,0,159,136,37,45,25,88,1,0,0,0,0

The most often thing people use computers for are for working, projects, information, or for reasearch. A @CAPS1 helps you find things like information on important people, countries, or just problems in socity. A @CAPS1 is great help when you need help on a project because it can help you get good ideas, information pictures or anything you need help with. Another reason why I think computers are great is because you have a lot of advantage and wasting @MONEY1 on a @CAPS1 is worth it. It's very helpful for learning too.

In the case of computers, people use this device to communicate with other people. The news can be read on the computer. Mainly, people use it to entertain themselves. Computers don't do anything to people, the people do it themselves. When I get home from a long day at school I sit down and go on the computer. I go on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4. I know you're thinking, ""But you just saw all your friends in school!"" @CAPS5, some of my friends aren't in any of my classes. I also have friends out of town, too. I use @CAPS4 to talk to my friend. Since I'm a kid I use it for a different reason than adults do. Grown-ups use @CAPS4 to find their old friends from high-school or college. I know my parents use it for this reason. E-mail is another major source. If there was an emergency in the family and someone doesn't have the time to call everyone then they just use email. In spanish class this year we have pen pals from @LOCATION1. We use epals.com to send emails to them. Computers can be used to talk to your family, friends, or to anyone around the world. Does anyone have all the time in the world? No of course not. So if you miss the news because you forgot about or you just don't have the time.

Computers are a great invention, and positively impact society. Take my friend @PERSON2, for example. Her family recently purchased a computer for their house. Before they had the computer, @PERSON2 had little knowledge of foreign places in the world and other peoples cultures. However, now @PERSON2 has read many articles online about countries in @LOCATION1. Furthermore, she watched numerous online videos about how people in @LOCATION2 live.

Studies show that @PERCENT1 of the time, people who use the internet have more knowledge than those who do not. Dr. @PERSON1 says that computers inflate the brain with useful knowledge that will educate people about important topics. If using the computer provides you with more knowledge, wouldn't you want to use it? Moreover, computers allow people to socialize with their friends online. It is a great way to keep up with long distance friends, or to work on a project with your partner. For example, last year my friends and I were doing a group project in @CAPS3 on @CAPS4 my friend and I sent each other our notes on e-mail, so that we could edit each others papers. I informed her of the mistakes she made, she did the same for me and we revised our mistakes and did very well me on our project. Also, kids can e-mail their teachers with questions on their homework, or they can even e-mail them their assignments! Don't you want your kids to be sucessful in school? Lastly, the computer is a great way to acess news. If someone is looking for a quick way to be informed of news, the internet is a great place to go. Most news channels even have websites with pictures, and video clips. Last week, my mom went to work early and when she got their it started to snow. She works an hour away, she needed to know if it was a snowday or not so that she could call someone to watch me and my younger siblings for the day. She didn't have a television in her office, so she went online; found the weather report, and found out we had a snowday. If she hadn't been able to find out from the internet she would have been nervous all day and might not have found someone to watch us. All in all, the internet is a wonderful invention that greatly benefits society. It is useful for many important things like knowledge of other countries, schoolwork, and important news.

For example, if you needed information about a certain subject, would you rather spend five minutes looking it up on your computer at home on spend @NUM1 minutes driving to a library to look it up there @CAPS2 computers saves us valuable time and a trip to the library that you don't have to take. This overall will help you get your work done faster, giving you more time to do the things you really enjoy. Although being a quick and easy information source, being able to talk to friends and family that are far away also contributes to computers effect on society. Another reason why computers are a great piece of technology is because you are able to talk to your friend and family that don't close. Even though we don't want them to, friends and family move away. No one wants to lose touch and with computers it is a million time easyer. You can easily go online and chat with someone that doesn't live in the state or even country you do. This makes it easier to keep intouch and see what friends and family are up to. Keeping in touch with family and friends to very precious to some people, but one of the most important things about computers is that they are portible devices. One final reason why computer benifit our society is because they are portible.When you are traveling and you need information quickly, you don't have time to stop at places to look up something or read a book about the subject. It is much easier to go onto your portible computer and look it up. You don't even have to leave the convieniece of your means of transportation. Because the computer is portible, this makes it popular for people who are always traveling or on the run. Computers provide these kinds of people and everyone else with a fast, convieniant and easy way to get information you need. Computers benifit everyone in our society. They provide us with a fast way to get information which makes things easyer for everyone. The let us keep in touch with friends and family so we always know what is going on. Finally they are a portible divice that creates more of a convieniance for travelers if they need information. Computers are one of the best pieces of technology even made. Technology is growing like the world around us. Many things are becoming easier and more convieniant because off the advances of computers.",,,,3255,31,589,905,19.0,572,3.62,1,207,1,144,118,48,34,26,72,3,0,0,0,0
9057,1,"People saying that we spend to much time on the computers & is saying it takes to much time away from exercising & family time. I disagree with that because computers have positive effect to. You can talk to people who move away, its helps people with information, & you can buy things online. Keep reading if you wish to look at more information. My first reason why I disagree with the negative of computer is that it can be use to talk to people who move. Sometimes it hard after when people move & you can't see them no more for a long time. Some time they forever & the only way you can comunncate with the is the computer. Its nice to check up on people after they just move away to see if their life is going good. Computer can even help send a letter from that person saying that he coming back soon. Another reason is that computers can help with information. If you a kid whos still in school that needs information for a project, a computer has all of that information. There could even be a time when you phone don't want to turn on, you could go to the website for the phone company to find out whats wrong. There isn't rough thing a computer can't help you with when you need information. It also has special things for certain. My fainal reason is that a computer has online stores. If you don't have a car to go places you can buy online. You could even rent a house online for thing like vacation. Even if theres something important you need you can buy it online & wait for it to be send to your house. You can even buy food online.

However, facebook is also another reason. People love to chat and meet new people. Also they play most games on facebook and catches they attention.

Three reasons I believe this are: kids spend all there time on the computer and never go outside or socialize in person, you can be targeted by strangers that can ruin your life, and you recieve false information. All these facts give me reason to believe that computers have a negative affect on today's society. First of all, I believe computers have a bad impact on my generation, and the generation before me, is that people are always on the computer and don't get enough time exercising or socializing in person. People nowadays spend all their time on the computer and time outside with family and friends. This has multiple bad affects. One of these affects is that people get fat because of the lack os exercise they get. @CAPS1 negative affect of this is that people's, especially kids, social skin are horrific. People spend all their time talking and the computer and never do it in person. Many people don't make eye contact and get very nervous when in real life situations. Not only that but they always use abbreviations, such as ble, and ttly, their writing skills are @CAPS1 problem with computers strangers on your life. Because people do everything the computer, such as theft. It happened to my mom. Also, on sites such as @CAPS2 and some dating websites, don't know who they;re talking to. And on those blind dating, you really have to watch out! A lot of and molestations happen if it computers. A final problem with computers is that there is a lot false information out there. Sites such as @CAPS3 allow average, untrained people put information that can be brased out there. Stuff that your kids can put into their school projects. Also, as I mentioned earlier, when your talking to people on @CAPS2 or any other dating site, you really don't know who you're talking to. I could be some @NUM1 year old offender who and say he's @NUM2. Finally the computers take away from the use of textbooks for research.

Excersing is a really good way to keep your body fresh alive. People who exersing yet their muscles brager to pick up or even do things that they couldn't do before.

There are people who love computers, enjoying the information that computers can get to them. Others think that they are unhealthy, instead of excersizing we sit at computers. We have been discussing this topic at school and a question came up, Who's right? Before computers, the library was where all the information came from. The source of our past, mathematic formulas, even diets, they all came from the inked pages of books. With computers, the hassle of finding the right book is eliminated. The internet's search engines give the user a pinpoint search to the designated topic. Multiples resources and lots of information, all with a click and a few seconds. This is a very good invention, the perfect tool for a curious student. As well as being efficient, computers offer a skill that can't be seen much. Typing on a computer is said to increase hand-eye coordination. As well as increasing this, the user can create a perfectly neat piece of writing or a document. So people @MONTH1 not notice it, but typing that long report due next @DATE1 @MONTH1 just keep your body in sync with your mind and eyes. ""@CAPS2 killed the cat."" This widely known phrase has came into effect in some experts minds. They are afraid that people are spending too much time on computers. As the hours whize by, the user's mind is baggled and lost within the splender of computer's neatness and information. They lose track of time and drift into an almost unconcious mindset. They don't go outsie or excersize. Experts are afraid that computers will bring people away from exercizing and staying healthy. Exercizing is key to anyone's life, and going without can cause serious damage.Obesity and heart disease can be in the future. People need to pay attention to their own selves, their own body. Computers bring attention to information which is not the same thing. As you know, @CAPS1, the number one killer in the @LOCATION1 today is heart disease. Computers, therefore, have a chance to keep this threat around. So the question still stands; @CAPS4 right? The answer is both. A steady diet of information and excersize will prevent all problems.

First of all I'm going to tell you that computers are very helpful and what computers have to offer you and the world. Computers are made from all types from desktop, mini computers, or laptops. I preffer the laptop the most because @CAPS2's more portable. But, this isn't the case I just want to prove that computers can help you with; talking online, making a profile page, own website, or even by things online for a friend or family member. I like all of these great features. Why do people use computers? There are so many reasons why. Some are maybe youc stuck in your house during the winter and don't like playing outside, or people in your family are buying you a christmas gift or birthday gift. Who knows but in the world I bet more than half of the world population have computers. Computers have to offer you alot. I personally like useing my computer because @CAPS2's helpful when I have to do research on a project from school or I want to chat with someone that lives on the other side of town or different state. my opinion about computers is that they are a very helpful, useful, and creative device. I could almost do any thing from looking up videos on youtube, going on facebook, @CAPS1, or buying something online. I use my computer ounce in a while not every day like some people in my society that are obsessed with going online. Maybe those kinds opf kids don't have friends they don't have anything to do. Who knows? What I'm trying to say is that I want you to know computers aren't bad. To top @CAPS2 all of is that you probably love your computer to like others. In my conclusion...

Real exercise is going outdoors, to play and improve your vody. Have you ever thought about exercising at all? If not, do you want to be over-weight/fat, and live a short life? Real exercise can just be described with two words known as work out. Working out is to push your strength to it's personal best, and reaching for higher goals. Push-ups help improve arm strength. Curl-ups help improve your waist and leg strength. These short exercises can help maintain a healthy life style. Eventually you'll see improvements in your body's strength and endurance. For those who aren't listening I have a question to. Have you ever thought of exercising at all? If not then you must be gaining weight. Staying on the computer isn't the way to lose weight. The way to lose weight lies in exercising daily, and eating healthy foods, I know, healthy foods equal ""@CAPS1!"" But I didnt say you couldn't add a healthy dressing onto them.

Like I have said, computers @MONTH1 benefit society, but they don't keep you physically fit. Exercising is not sitting on a chair, typing to friends, clicking on a mouse, and having eye movements. Exercising is going outside, pushing your body to it's limits, to exceed past your goals. Remember, exercising can be described as workouts, and help maintain health.

They provide communication with others, entertainment of numerous types and also are very helpful with learning and improving ones knowledge. I feel computers have inovated history in on amazing way. To start I feel i computers share a wide variety of communication to others, whether it is through email, facebook, twitter or any other of the millions of ways in communicate through a computer. Firstly, many believe that the computers can be used for and it cuts down on a person's interaction with family and friends however it can actually make them even closer @CAPS1 chating on line, it gives them a chance to fully express themselves. Time makes them closer because they then are honest with one another. You might not be out experiencing the world, but instead on inside experiencing technology. Secondly, when you use a computer webpage such as facebook you can easily meet new people. When you are online a webpage like facebook gaming doesn't decrease your amout of exercise, it actualy could be increasing it. Depending on the game it actually could be providing you with a work out. Also computer can give entertainment through pictures. So many pictures sharing websites or even google, images, pictures can be considered entertainment. Entertainment can be very importand to many and can be found on computer. Lastly, computers can also use not be tought through things such as online colleges. Students can have easier, stress free college @CAPS1 taking onlin classes. @CAPS1 creating online classes, it could a new generation of learning.

At times you @MONTH1 want to speak to family and friends that @MONTH1 be in another state or country and you can't do that over the phone without using a phone card or it will just send your bill through the roof but with internet you don't have to worry about that because the internet is a world wide website that can go any where you want it to and leaving your bill at the same rate every month and who wouldn't want that. Another thing is that internet gives you access to evrything you can think of, all you have to do is google it and many different websites pop up on that one thing and each one you go to gives you new information on that one thing @CAPS1 everything on internet is just a click away and your accessed.

Either way, they @MONTH1 end up glued to the games for hours. Which is why strongly believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. People in @LOCATION1 have been getting bigger and bigger since the @DATE1's and most of it is due to lack of physical exercise. One out of every four @CAPS2 gets no physical exercise at all. Most people would rather stay inisde with a computer on their lap or a controller in their hand. A few yeras ago, @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS5 game company came out with the wii a new, interactive game console that was did to get peoople active and off their butts. But if this was the goal, how come they're making games where people can sit on thier couches to play? The answer: it's not the games, kids and adults everywhere choose to take the easy way out. They would rather be attached to their games rather than outside doing something. The outdoors is the most beautiful thing around us. Thick, green grass covering the ground around us, with tall trees for climbing. Activities all around us yet no one seems to take advantage of them. Why not enjoy a game of soccer in your backyard or a ride down the street. Nature surrounds us and so it us hard to believe that people can go day without enjoying it. Computers have introduced a new way of keeping in contact with friends and family. Emails, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 calls have taken over the way we talk to friends. I always hear my mom or dad say ""@CAPS6 I was your age, we didn't have things that. If we wanted to see our friends, we'd have to walk and meet them."" I can even say I've become a person who has done something like that. Instead of walking across the street to visit my neighbor, I would text her to talk to her. Seeing your friends is important, do not ruin it with your computer. Now that you've realized what a computer can't do for you, why don't you go outside and enjoy a hike. Better yet, call a friend you haven't seen in a while and ask her to go on a hike with you.

9075,1,"Everyday more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees they benefit society. I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They benefit people because they improve and teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to enhance knowledge of the world around them, and give people the chance to talk with friends and family. Even though some individuals become ""addicted"" to using the computer, the positive effect over power the negative ones. A positive effect of using the computer is that it improves your hand-eye coordination. On a computer the keyboard has many different letters, numbers, and applications. If someone uses a computer enough they can memorize all the keys and use them without looking at amazing rates. To help losen the keys or the internet there is many programs. These programs can also used by schools for special needs classes to learn the alphabet and number orders. To enter certain applications you have to use the ""mouse"" to click them. When there is many different applications going on at the same time they can become very difficult to do. From young ages they teach children how to use computers. Small toys that are made to look like laptops are used to teach toddlers to use computers. This will ensure that the next generation is as knowledgeable as it can be. Another positive effect that comes from the computer is the ability to learn about the world we live in. Using the internet people can go into educational websites to learn about different topics. In schools teachers use computers to create report cards and categories grades. They also can look up teaching methods for these classes and point out homework/worksheets for their students to do. The students can use the computer to help with research on certain areas that need to be learned. Now, schools require students to type up used documents for reports, instead of pen and pencil which could look not neat and unorganized. Large businesses have taken advantages of the internet and use the world wide web to sell and market certain items. This makes it easier to the buyers and sellers because they never have to see each other and it can be delivered through the mail to your door step. Another positive effect of using the computer is to connect and share with people all around the world. Computer companys have created websites such as @CAPS1, myspace, twitter, @CAPS2, and email to connect with others. You can use these web sites for personal uses or for business. A long time ago people would have to send letters by the mail to other people to talk to them. Now, in the blink of an eye you can send messages and updates to people across the globe. Teenagers use websites to share pictures and info. about themselves to others. Businessmen can use email accounts to send stock information & powerpoint projects to other people easily. The main reason the internet was ever created was to create a program to send messages over long ones. The computer is very complicated, but useful to tool to see. It can be used to improve hand-eye coordination, learn more about the world, and talk with friends and family. I believe that computers should be used and are very important in today's society.

For a fact people use the computer to do taxes, if they have a busy schedule using the computer is an easy process. As you can see, many people use the computer for good things, also to learn, and it fits with a busy schedule.

9084,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people. This is because people get addicted and dosessed. With the computer one it is quite hard to stop using it. In this case, this person will most likely gain more weight because they are no-exercizing, their grades will drop they are in school and they will lose relationships with many people. Some people think that computers have a positive afecct on people because they can teach you about faraway places. They are wrong because you can also learn about far away places from books. A more reliable source. Afterall, according to @PERSON2, computer application teacher on @CAPS3, @PERCENT1 of websites are not trustworthy so you are better or getting information are of books or magazines. First off, obesity and weight is a big problem in @LOCATION1. The idea of being on the computer all day sort or ""eggsen"" people to cab more and exercize less. This is because humans tend to act so addicted to being on their computer wheter is playing games or chatting with theri friends, that they will non stop being on the computer to go to the gym or someone like that. Also, people tend to eat more when they are on the computer because they are very bored, and when people are bored and not occuping themselves. These type of problems all present in children and teenagers foremost. If our country in trying to prevent child obesity increasing, then why we cutting how much someone computer and make sure they exercise? According to @PERSON1, of @CAPS3 computer, "" more kids are spending more of their time on their computers than participating in school sports because they they can't have time. Really they are just home playing video games on their computer. ""This is very true, al a teenager I know who: is happening to their children because they will no, but they will play video games. If we alow these kids to keep playing these games, we wil everyday. Secondly kid are so with playing on their computer, their grade beacsue they do not do their homework or they do not study for tests/quizzes. I took a in my @NUM1 grade algebra class and the result or @NUM2 kids have than aB- because they spend this time on the computer, Those children need help, and need to be discipline by their parents so they stop using their time on the computer, any uses wiser. For example my older brother used to be on the computer all day and he did not do any of his homework. Eventually he realize was failing and he to stay back if he did not bring his grade up. Indeed, he did bring his grades are he currently has and he will not need to stay back. Children need a wake-up can just like my brother. Computers aren't going to help yoou in lies or make you smarter, school will. Children need to learn that lessen or else our socity will be doomed. Children are need help. As a town, we take action and help these people out and make sure that they use their time wisely not using on the computer. I know that computers @MONTH1 be fun, but in the end, you'll spent in all your time on it. Whether you fail classy or you become over weight.

9087,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 donÕt we ever see vids out anymore? How come they aren't playing with friends or riding lives? How come we never see them interacting with their families? I will give you one good reason, COMPUTERS! Teenagers aren't having fun because their being brainwashed. We don't see kids out anymore because they are too busy playing these online sureel life games. Wich is were you get to creat an on-line life. You get to make everythiing up. They are not getting any excersize out of this. Maybe their brain is getting a workout. Their index fingers @CAPS2 might be getting a workout. But the rest of their body is not. If you let your body sit these and not any exercise you are going to collect the fat and not be able to can, @CAPS2 what are you going to do about your friends? You won't have as much time to play with them. Sure maybe you get to play online. But where is the fun in that & @CAPS3 and my best friends made a club that waas really fun. You had to do a ceremony to get in. But it is a. You cant do that on a piece of machinary. You can't create a memory that last forever. You @CAPS2 can create a bond with someone on the internet. It is not the same thing as up close because you can tell when their use lying or not. Which brings me up to family. How much time do you spend with your family? @PERCENT1 of adults that I surveyed said that their kids instead of comming to dinner at the dinner to be able thier kids grab their food and rush off the computer. Have teenagers ever thought how that might hurt your parents. How many younger brothers or sisters that their teenage brother as sister hogs the computes. Teenagers that go on the computer are si self-absorbed that they don't realize how mean the are racing. @CAPS4 teenagers next time you are on a computer remember about your friends and what you are missing out on. Thinking abou your health and what you are doing to your body. And last but costainly not least remember your family. No matter what you will allways have them, @CAPS4 think about how you treat them the next time they wanna use the computer.

9085,1,"Citizens of @LOCATION1, I write to you today to iform you about our world of technology; especially computers. What you think about what we do with this advanced piece of technology is, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, right? Well, yes computers supply those websites for us. However, there is so much more that computers provide for us. The internet, the ability to explore and learn about the world without taking a step out of your house! Email; its very nice to recieve mail. I agree. However, email is so much simpler and easier to do! So think about it, computers truley have changed our world. The internet is one of the greatest inventions in our time. It can give you information about any place in this whole world and even better the whole solar system! The internet gives you movie times, games scores, pictures; almost anything you can think of it has it for you. I remember a few years back when I was looking for the best cheesecake recipe. I could find; the one with just enough cheese and just enough cake. I went cookbook through cookbook and could not find just the right one. So I go ask my mom and she went right to the computer; no cookbook or anything! She pulled of a page in a matter of seconds with the perfect @PERSON1 recipe for cheesecake! I learned that day, that with cookbooks!; I'm going straight to the internet. As you can see the internet is fast, reliable and a great way to find the perfect cheesecake recipe. Another great use of the computer is e-mail. Email, the @CAPS3 for parents and adults. But honestly, millions of emails are sent everyday, and adults are glued to it. It's how they keep in touch with friends family everyone. Sending a quick messange to a buddy is so much easier than calling them on the phone or sending a letter. No more envelopes or sticking stamps that cost money! Send an email... for free! Now your probably thinking, why not just call the person on the phone? Well, what if your running late for your daughters soccer game and you don't have time stay and chatt with @CAPS4 @CAPS5 about how proud she is that @PERSON2 lost his first? Just slip on over a quick email and you can save @ORGANIZATION1 for later! Now think, the computer is also technecally saving you gas money. Instead of running out to the store and wasting gas to see wheel to buy for dinner, why not go on the internet and see what you can make out of wheel you already have and save that gas for something else? If you want to go to the movies but don't know what is playing, instead of gas driving to see, just on the internet and figure out whats playing. If you really think about it, doing these @PERSON2 things can save you gas and maybe put a @PERSON2 money in your pocket from the gas you are saaving! After reading this article, I hope you can agree with me that the computer is a great effect on people. There are so many things to learn about without leaving the room.

9089,1,"Sure, computers help people learn about far away places and things like that, but what were we using before computers? The atlas and maps. What computers are doing though is depriving family time, exercising, and the wonderful outdoors when spent to long on. I can tell you from personal experience that the computer does take away from families. For example, my brother @PERSON1 spends at least three to four hours a day on the computer. You dont even want to know how long on the weekends. While the rest of my family is enjoying each others company watching t.v. or something, my brother is clicking or typing on the computer. He misses out or a lot of fun things and spending time with his family. The constant hours on the computer have also developed an attitude in my brother. If you polietly ask him to get off hell either whine or get irrated. As if something precious has been taken away from him. The computer. What is so fun or healthy about it. All you're doing is sitting on a chair not really moving much for however long you're on for. Where is the exercise? While on the computer you could exercising or at least moving around. When you just sit at the computer your not really circulating, but when you do jumping jacks or jog around your whole body is circulating. Letting more air blood and other things run up to your brain. Plus, the result of not exercising because you were to busy on the computer is that you can gain weight. In the end you're not healthy at all. One last reason too much time on a computer is bad is because you don't get to get outdoors. Where you can enjoy beautiful scenery, playful animals, and fresh air. When you're on the computer all you are looking at is a screen with whatever you're looking at on it. When outside you can see the beautiful sun shinning down or the big blue sky. If you're anything like myself I don't think you'd want to miss out on something like that why don't you go outside today or maybe spend time with your family. Instead of staring at some computer all day. What's so important about it?",,,,2067,28,391,553,13.9642857143,386,1.28,0,189,2,79,80,25,27,17,54,2,0,0,1,0

If you said yes to any of these questions, then you you will probably agree with me i f when I say that I think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are a great way to communicate with others. They also provide good learning websites. Computers can also be used for entertainment purposes too. @CAPS1 you wish you could talk to your friends without wasting precious phone minutes? If you @CAPS1, then you should think about getting a computer. There are so many social networking sites out there like @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and more. On these websites people can talk to their friends through chat rooms, wall posting, etc. If you are someone who has friends that live far away, then these websites would be completely useful to you. You could also get in touch with a relative that doesn't live near you. For example, I have aunts, cousins, and grandparents that live in @LOCATION1, so its nice to be able to talk to them without getting charged with long distance caving fees. Computers also provide fantastic learning websites! You can look up history fore a report you're writing. The internet also has hundreds of educational websites where kids learn. Adults can even take college courses online. I don't know aobut you, but that sounds pretty useful to me. I mean I know a lot of adults work, so it's difficult to work and go back to college at the same time. These online courses save time and you don't have to leave your house to take them. Computers can also be used for entertaiment many people go on fun gaming websites when they have free time. There are even some websites where kids learn responsibility by having to take care of a virtual pet. They go on andfeed it everyday, so they learn how to take care of something. Computers are a great way to relax if you dont own a tv. You can watch movies on computers now, so many people don't see the point of owning a tv and a computer. Computers usually cost less money than tv's @CAPS1, so it would be cheaper to own a computer. As you can see, computers have many positive effects on people. You could communicate with long-lost friends. You could even learn on computers! You can have fun on computers too.

I wouldn't because computers have very bad affects, but mostly on younge people, older people have alot to do like work and @CAPS3 they work with computers then they are really benefiting. Younge people are glued to the computer screen I know I am, someone can ask me, whats the first thing you do when you get home? And I would responde with go on the computer. They would ask, for homework, right? I would respond with, no facebook, youtube, I also play games! And thats the honest truth, sadly I spend so much hours on the computer, but @CAPS2 not the only one, all of my friends are addicted, even my little brother is, he can't go a day without going on wheo were glued to the computer screen @CAPS1 use or time on it.

9091,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe computers are a great help out to our society. They allow us to reach information in a short time, communicate with others around the world, and best of all, they help us get through life easier and enjoyably. @CAPS2 computers in our generation, the world will not make progress from the years before. First of all, computers allow us to reach urgent news in a short amount of time. For example, what if there is a short amount of time. For example, what if there is a massive earthquake nearby and you didn't know about it? You would have no time to escape when the earthquake arrives, thus, you might die. Moreover, the computers keep records and tracks dangers so @CAPS3 could live in a safe environment. I remember when an earthquake struck in @LOCATION1, computers tracked it's movement and alarmed us by saying there could be another one. To our surprise, there was but fewer people suffered because of the computer warnings, @CAPS2 computers, more people would be in danger, and @CAPS3 don't want that. In my opinion, it is important to communicate with others around the world. However, writing letters make quick communication very difficult. Computers have helped us tremendously to communicate with others around the world. I've observed that at least @PERCENT1 of the students in my school use the website facebook on computers to communicate everyday. Furthermore, because my family migrated to the @LOCATION2, @CAPS3 are not able to see other family members very often. When @CAPS3 heard of the computer messaging program called @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 were able to see our family through chatting everyday. Computers have changed our lives dramatically because there could be quick communication all around the world. @CAPS2 a doubt, computers have affected our lives greatly. The most important reason is because it helps us get through life easier and more enjoyably. Before computers were invented, even writings had to be done by hand. Although there were typewriters, it was hard to erase mistakes you made. When, interviewed a person who grew up in that period, they would say, ""You guys who are growing up in the new generation with computers are very lucky."" In addition, computers allow work to get done faster. For example, if there if was a big school project that needs to be completed in a short amount of time, computer websites allow research to be done quickly. If you're done, you get more free time. You wouldn't want to sit for hours looking through books and encyclopedias, would you? Therefore, computers made life easier and more enjoyable.

And you @CAPS2, you should spend as much time with them as you can. @CAPS3 grandma died about @NUM4 years ago, from smoking. @CAPS3 grandpa was there when she was dying and he still smoke. Now hes in the same position that she was in. Computer's can take away the time you spend with your family, and you shouldn't take away time. from then, @CAPS3 mom is always telling me to come down stairs and hang out with her and @CAPS3 brother and sister. Whenever that happens. Im usually on the computer. But I always come because nothing is better than family. Now I have come to a conclusion that @CAPS4 should also use books instead of computers, get more sleed and spend much more time with their famiy.",,,,2099,31,394,520,12.7096774194,385,0.89,1,192,1,97,79,17,50,14,52,0,0,0,1,1

Computers are needed for class work, homework and if kids have a little free time they can enjoy the computer. It @CAPS9 more important for schools to have computers because teachers tend to give a lot of projects throughout the school year. Kids who donÕt have computers at home try to stay after school so they can do research on projects. Students stay after to type long papers for projects, some kids donÕt like writing long papers cause they donÕt have the best hand writing so they need to type so the teacher dose not take points off. For project there needs to be alot of research so students donÕt repeat the same reasons. @PERCENT1 of teachers say that many students ask to stay after or project cause they donÕt have a computer at home. Homework @CAPS9 important through the school year to some teachers give homework that need to be done on the computer. My brother @PERSON1 lives in @LOCATION1 and since teachers started giving homework that needs a computer for it @PERCENT2 of the students in the school grades bare improve because theyÕre doing their but using the computer to check it over and are starting to approve homework on the computer cause their grades a gang up.

Kids get to have fun after their homework @CAPS9 done are less likely to do drugs, get in trouble, and end up in jail than kids who donÕt do their homework and have to stay in the house all day with nothing to do.

As opposed to @CAPS2 sitting in their seats and listening to a teacher lecture, they could go on the computers and learn the lesson in a more hands on way. A recent study taken at @ORGANIZATION1 that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 who studied for tests on the computer did better than those who didn't. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 learn lessons on the computer by playing, earning, games the have a more positive response by having a better attitude towards learning. @PERSON1, a fifth grade teacher, says, ""@CAPS1 I let my @CAPS2 play games about spelling to study for their test, they all got a @NUM1 or higher."" @CAPS2 have a lot more fun playing on the computer than doing worksheets. @CAPS1 kids play educational games on the computer they try harder and get more competitive to try and win the game. Computers are a simple way for people to communicate with each other. If people need a quick response to something or need to tell someone something then can send an email. Gmail is usefull because you can instantly get a response to someone, as opposed to a letter which could take days to reach a person. @NUM2 people prefer emailbecause it is faster. You can also communicate with a person using a webcam. People who have family members outside of the @LOCATION2 catntoople while seeing their face, instead of just hearing their voice, which is what you do on a phone. @CAPS1 I was younger my dad traveled a lot for business. I always loved talking to him via webcam because I felt like he was in the same room as me. Many people also love using websites like facebook or myspace to communicate with people. People enjoy using these websites because they can find old friends from college or high school that they have lost touch with over the years. A myspace user said, ""I found my college roommate through myspace, we had lost touch but now we are great friends again."" Computers help people gain skills that they will later need in life. Many jobs @DATE1 in @LOCATION1 require you to use a computer if you don't know how you might not get hired. Powerpoint is one skill that you need to know for work. If you are in the marketing or advertising business you need to know how to present your ideas neatly, clearly, and creativity. If you become a personal assistant you need to know how to use email or the internet. My moms first job was as a personal assistant she told if she didn't know how to use the computer she would have never been able to make it and would have gotten fired.

The positive affects is your kid can do his homework on the computer and use spell check on there writing assiments. When you kid go on to the computer he is learning computer skill like looking up stuff school or sport equitment that he wants for the new sport sessons. Also your kid can make friend on line with fase book and other online computer cating sites. So you kid will not be afread to talk to people when he getts older. The conputer can also be a negative effect like he can alot of time playing games on the conputer insted of going outside to play and that can lead to be obecidy and unsoshal. There are many different sights to go on to talk to you friend like twitter or facebook most kid go on facebook everyday and get of and go outside. But some times kid just want to stay on the computer and not go outside and get the right exercize they need. Studys show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kid spend more than five hours on facebook a day. That is not good for your kid and just wait to you see your bill. So after reading my letter I hope you have leard about the good and bad thing about the computer.

The computer system is helpful but some people @MONTH1 find it too useful and becoome addicted, the cost of thesse machines can be quite large as well. ""@CAPS4 health is more important than fun"" said health expert @PERSON2. With the new technologies health is a factor, for example, @CAPS3 if someone never wants to stop on the computer to go outside and get some exercize. Although the internet gives us information such as weather, @CAPS3 about games, people love games and @CAPS3 if they can never win but get close, then they @MONTH1 stay trying for hours. Over @NUM1 children have had eye problems of a result of looking too long in the past @NUM2 years. But one might say ""but barely anyone gets addicted"", but people do, look on gaming sites, networks for people, etc. The problem is growing, and it needs to be stored. @CAPS3 really is a problem, is addicts. Being on the computer for more than @NUM2 hours is bad enough, but @CAPS3 about addicts, they could be on playing more more than @NUM4 hours each day, getting next to nothing exercize. Addicts of the system really don't care about anything else exept the game they love, videos, ect., but some aren't real, go play a real game like tennis and work the extra @NUM5 pounds on weight you put on off. Which you got or eating chips and not moving because of the computer. Not all people are in trouble of getting addicted, for example people that, or are just looking on the weather. Then someone @MONTH1 say ""how does someone get addicted?"" You can tell when they talk, or if you look at their eyes, they'll be tired. The price of these machines is ridickulus, a gaming computer which many addicts buy, can cost thousands, and is it really worth it? Of course not, the the person won't get exercize, they'll get addicted, and they could had givin the money away to a greater cause, like @CAPS5 or @LOCATION1, ""@CAPS3 more important yourself, of many more who need more?"" The answer is to not to just think for yourself. In @CAPS7 @NUM6 children die every day in a result of starvation and you could help them. In the end people should try to keep healthy because they can't resist playing their little ""fun game"". The cost of these life nasters is huge spanning machines?

For example you won't be able to research about places and people or communicate as well, also you wouldn't have the computer to help teach you hand eye coordination, computers have a good effect on people for they help out in many ways. Computers help people to do research on far away places and people. The only other way besides a computer to research is books which people get at libraries and @PERCENT1 of all librarys only have fiction books for children and adults. But @PERCENT2 homes in @STATE1 have computers for people to learn about faraway places. Therefore computers effect on people is good because it helps people to learn and research faraway places. Computers also help train have eye coordination. Just playing games on the computers will give people better hand eye coordination. @PERCENT3 of people who play on the computer have better hand-eye coordinations then other who don't. @PERSON2 gym teacher of the @CITY1 school of arts states that he sees that kids that have superior hand eye coordination play tons of games on the computer. He also recalls move people got better at hand eye coordination faster on the computer rather than slow training at school. That is why computers have a good effect on people. Computers also allow communication. Communication is another reason why computers have a good effect on people. @PERSON1 has stated that she loves how computers help her communicate with her dad when he is far away. Computers commmunication system allow people to talk to others by email or web cam even if your far or close. many people love how computers communication system works @NUM1 out of @NUM2 college students or yardid. That is why the effect computers have on people is good. Computers help people in many ways they help them to communicate to people faraway or close.

9105,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 devices that improve our lives are being invented every day. One of the most life-changing of all of these devices is the computer. Computers improve the quality of our lives in a variety of ways. Some of these include letting us learn about faraway places and people, teaching us hand-eye coordination, and letting us talk to our friends more easily. Here is why computers have positive effect on people. One reason why computers are having a positive effect on people is that they give you access to a wealth of information. For example, if you wanted to find information about pyramids of @LOCATION1, all you need is a few clicks on your mouse and you can find hundreds of websites full of information. That's much more than you would be able to find in a library! Computers also make learning about faraway places easier because @CAPS1 websites are being created all the time, so the information you read is always up-to-date. In a library, the books might be too old and lacking the @CAPS1 information that has been discovered. A third way that computers make learning easier is that you don't even have to go to a library to learn about interesting places. You can find information right from your own house! Since computers let people find a wealth of up-to-date information without ever leaving their home, they definately have a positive effect on people. Another way that computers benefit society is that they teach hand-eye coordination. One way in which computers do this is simply by having us move mouse with our hand to make the arrow on the screen move where we want it to. We also learn hand-eye coordination when we play computer games, because to play one you need to be able to look at the screen and quickly know where to move your hand. @PERSON1, a well known doctor says, ""@CAPS2 a computer is one of the best ways to improve hand-eye coordination, and improving this skill will help you to anything from catching a ball to swatting a fly."" @CAPS3 you can see, computers can improve your life by teaching you this very important skill. The last reason why computers benefit society is that they allow people to communicate with their friends more easily. If a friend of yours moved away and you wanted to communicate wit them, you would normally have to send them a letter, and it can take weeks before you get a letter back. But @CAPS2 a computer, you can send them an e-mail, and it's possible to get a response in just minutes!",,,,2483,21,441,676,21.0,437,4.4,1,191,0,111,89,29,24,10,52,2,0,0,0,1

Yes, some believe that over use of computers has a negative impact, but in moderation the internet can be a valuable tool. Computers are a learning tool. You can learn ready anything from the internet, @MONTH1 it be preparing a dish for dinner or fixing something that @MONTH1 be broken. The internet is an instant source of information. Sites such as @ORGANIZATION1 let you type in the name of your topic and find every site with information about it. Many children can learn new things via computers. When I was in a younger grade the teachers had us play computer games that also taught us about our subject. Another important feature that computers contribute is typing. Today, nearly everything is typed. At school nearly every essay we write will need to be typed at some point. Typing teaches hand-eye coordinaton and correct spelling and grammar. But, computers are not only used for learning they are also entertaining. The second main use for the internet is news and entertainment. If someone needs to be updated they can just log on to their computer, laptop or even phone, to get the latest news instantly to them. @MONTH1 it be the news on the @CAPS1' latest speach or just who won the sports tournament, people can have this information at the speed of light. Think of a day when it's cold and raining outside. Instead of being outside in the dark and damp, you can be warm inside watching your favorite shows without any commercials or re-runs, through the internet. The internet is an important tool that can be used for nearly anything. Many of the positive features of computers outwiegh the negative. Computers and the internet have a very positive effect in the right amount. Many of the things that people say computers keep us away from, they can actually help with. Lets say you're going on a trip with your family, you can print out a map and get to your destination twice as last.",,,,2118,25,371,568,14.84,366,1.67,1,189,2,107,67,27,17,17,48,2,0,0,0,0
9116,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you know @NUM1 million @CAPS5 spend over @NUM2 minutes on the computer every month? Nowadays, computers are taking away family and friend time, excercising time, and they are brainwashing us, and our children. Lets talk more about this interesting topic. About @NUM3 million families have reportadly lost atleast @NUM4 hours a month. A family should spend more time with their children than a computar. How the child grows depends on how much family time the child gets. Unfortunetly, families have wasted time using the computer. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 use the computers an average @NUM5 hours a day! Shocked yet? What until we talk about excercising time. The computer can also elimanate your excercising time. Heres the story of @PERSON1. Hi, I'm @PERSON1, and I @NUM6. @PERSON1 spends @NUM5 hours a day on the computer. One day his mother called. She said, ""when are you going to the docters?"". @PERSON1 answerd ""when I'm done with the computer."" @PERSON1 listened and visited the docter. He found out he had cancer. The computer can't tell you that. The cancer was so servere, he could've died any moment. Thats why you need excercise time, not computer time. The computer also brain washes us. Lets talk more about this topic. The computer also brain washes us. We do stuff based on the computer. Our children only listen to music, not their parents. Computers are like electronic drugs. They are addictive and bad for everyone. I disagree with saying computers are a benifit for society. It wastes family and friend time excercising time, and it brainwashes our children.

9115,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 do you feel about computers? Do you think they are good, bad, useful, or not useful. I strongly think computers are good and very useful to people. You can learn about people and places, talk to family and friends, and it improves your hand-eye coordination. The main reason why computers are good is because you can learn from them. You can learn about people, places, and things from computers. For example, you can get the latest news on the internet like, if there is a local storm or traffic. There are portable computers, so if you are not home, you can look at the traffic for your drive home. People also learn from their jobs on computers. For example, if you work on a computer, you can learn to keep things on your computer, process claims, or even keep records of your patients. Finaly, you can learn about the latest news about famous people or important events. Another important reason why computers are good is because you can talk to family and friends. Most of my family lives out of state in @LOCATION1, so I can talk to my family down there. We can check in with eachother and tell eachother @CAPS1 we have been doing. On computers, you can talk to your friends too! You can talk to friends that you @MONTH1 not see a lot or maybe just a friend from school or work. This is a good way to find out missing assignments, or a question you @MONTH1 have on an assignment. My final reason I think computers are good is because they improve your hand-eye coordination. This is very good if you play a sport like baseball or softball. You can improve your hand-eye coordination and that could help you hit the ball. It could also help you catch the ball or dodge it if the pitch is going to hit you. Going on the computer and improving your hand-eye coordination could help you improve your reflexes. If your hand-eye coordination is good and you know that the ball is going to hit you, your reflexes will improve and will help you dodge that speeding ball. I believe that computers are very good for people. My reasoning is that they teach you and inform you about things, keep you in touch with family and friends, and helps your reflexes and hand-eye coordination, @CAPS2 what do you think about computers and their usefulness?",,,,2270,25,409,578,16.36,406,2.45,1,140,0,94,78,33,16,25,50,3,0,0,1,1

First it teaches hand I cordination. If you own a compiny that uses cranes and big machines like that you dont want someone that dosent even know how to catch a ball operating those things. If you are in baseball team you need hand eye cordination. Second, people use the computer for reasurch. I herd that @PERCENT1 of people use a computer for reasurch other than a book. I think you find more information in a computer than a book. Also you just type what you're finding and in less than a second you're there with all the information that you need.

Others however, argue this advancement in technology will lead us away from @CAPS5 the traditional methods @ORGANIZATION1 doing things that @CAPS4 @CAPS5 know and love @CAPS1 I believe computers are a great thing that help us in many ways, I more dominantly think that computers are @CAPS2 to develop to the point where it is out @ORGANIZATION1 control.

9118,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1. I do not believe that computers benefit our society. People are spending way too much time on the computer instead of exercising, enjoying nature, and spending time with their friends and families. Thanks to computers, many people aren't spending as much time exercising as they should I believe that our country is the fattest,or one of the fatiest in the world. Approximately @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 are overweight, and with all the computer games and things made for computers, that percentage can only get higher. People that are overweight have a higher chance of getting diabetes, and having a stroke or heart attack. Having computers and using them all the time as many do will lead obesity, and sometimes death. Computers lead people to not spend nearly as much time as they should enjoying nature. A person won't be around forever, and they should spend a good chunk of their life enjoying the beautiful all around us. Also, nature won't be around forever with the global climate change and all of the resources us humans of the world are using, nature will not always be as pretty as it is now. He should take the oppotunities we have to go see it. Computers take away many of those oppotunities. Being on the computer a lot leaves little time to hangout and deal with your friends and family. I know that when I am on the computer the only thing I want is to be left alone and not to have to chat or hang out with people that I love! That shouldn't be happening, and if it happens to me to me then I'm sure that it must be happening to some one else. Computers could lead the a loss, and it's hard to go through a life with no. Computers do not benefit our society at all. They keep people from seeing the beauty of our world, they keep people from staying fit, and they can lead to the loss of friends.

9119,1,"Everyday more and more @CAPS1 are being sucked into the world of technologie. The world of iphones, ipods, @CAPS2 and computers. With one computer you can hold the world in your hands. What could be better than this? It might seem like the perfect world, but this world is harmful, unhealthy and undisirerable. Computers in our lives, children are negitivly effecting their growth, grown-ups are not exercising, and people all over are missing out on the experiences of life. In no way are computers benaficial to @LOCATION1. Children are some of the most beings in this world. Their bodies are at an extremly fragiel age, especily their brains. They are growing everyday and their are many things that could possibly harm them. One of these things are computers. Staring at a screen for hours on end is terrible for them. It is killing brain cells every minute. And its almoust as if they have no choice. More and more kids are being told to type homework or visit websites which could turn to hours on the computer. For kids of an older age they have to much access. Facebook, @CAPS3, these thing can result in spending days infront of the computer screen. Sitting in front of the screen for that long, can then result in junk food. It is much easier to sit there with a bag of chips then a plate of salad. Kids are giving up healthy eating for junk food as we speak. All beccause of the obsesed addiction to be on the computer. Not only are they eating unhealthy but they are loosing out time to exersise. People all over ar filling up their time with the internet you have everything in the palm of your hands when you have a computer. With a computer there is no need to go out to a store to get new close. Or rent a movie. It is now all on line. Because of this people are getting excercise less and less every day. By halving every thing on the internet people are not only missing out the exercises but they are missing out on the experiences of life. They loose the of being out side in nature of the rush to the library or a store.

9121,1,Computers have positive effects on people by letting them go online and talking with family and friends. Also by you could play games on it as you could just look up things on google if you dont know what something is or if you donÕt know what it looks like. Talking with family and friends online is a lot easier because you wont have to keep a phone next to your ear and if you had to do something you wouldnt have to hang up you could just say hold on and do what you have to do. It is also quicker because if you have a brother or sister that is always on the phone or if your parents are on it you wouldnt have to wait until they got off you could just go on the computer and talk to the person you have to talk to. I think that talking through skype or is better because you could see the person that your talking to. Playing games on line could help you out if you wanted to build something you could probably find something online that could help you learn how to build it. Or if you had a long day at school or work and you want to play a game you could go on the computer and play anything you wanted to. Another fun thing that you could do is that if you were having a sleepover or if you were playing with your sister or brother is that one of you could go first and the person that goes next could try to beat you at any game you could find on the computer. The last reason that i'm going to talk about is google. People could look up a lot of stuff using google. They could look at pictures of their favorite celebrity or just look up pictures to see if they have one of you or someone you know. You could also type in something that your looking for and it would give you links to go somewhere else to find more information on what you typed in the box. Google is a fun and fast way to get things done and those are the reasons why I think that computers have a positive affect on people.,,,,1903,13,386,481,29.6923076923,382,7.52,0,141,1,65,92,10,15,22,54,0,0,0,0,0
9120,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I think that there is a negative effect the computer have on people. Three reasons why computers these effects are people becoming unhealthy, their vision can get critically damaged, and they lose connection to the outside world. Given these three reasons, what do you the reader think? Computers are making people overweight and it is unhealthy. My father, @PERSON3 has been using his computer more often because of all his reports he has to write. In the past two monts, @PERSON3 has put on @NUM1 pounds. He said ""@CAPS2 I didn't have all these reports, I would be outside and in the gym exercising. ""That is one story. However, @PERSON3 is not the only one with this type of problem. Furthermore, @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1, has done a study of weight gain. In his study, @PERCENT1 of people who have gained weight, said it was from using the computer too often. Due to this weight gain, people are more risk of getting heart attacks, or type @NUM2 diabetes. Clearly, people who use computers frequently will most likely put on weight and open themselves up to more risks. Another negative effect that computers have on people is their vision. People's vision are getting worse because of looking at their monitor for too long. In a recent study preformed by @PERSON2, he has discovered that @PERCENT2 of people with perfect vision have gone from @NUM3 vision to @NUM4 vision in just a little over @NUM2 months. This @MONTH1 not seem to bad unless you have children. It is worse for children because @CAPS2 their vision becomes worse too, they will need glasses, which leads to a less over @MONEY1. @CAPS2 i were a parent, I would be setting an example for the children and be going outside to get exercise, to stay healthy and not damage eyes. Now's its you turn. Kids are losing friends in a heart beat. This is because they are spending too much time on the computer, and not enough time outside or with friends. My friend, @PERSON4, has gotten @NUM6 suspensions in the past month because he lost all his friends. He said that he has been on the computer four hours a day in a row for the last week. His grades have gotten worse and he has no social life. He is not the only one, though. @PERSON4 claims that his whole school doesn't have any friends due to their time spent on a computer. Sounds to me that computer effect kids too. Due to the facts I have just read, I think computers have a negative effect on people.

The reason why these percentages are so high is because computers give you a much wider range on education, whether it's taking an online qiuz or home tutor or another studying method. This is why I believe computers have a very positive effect on people lives. Lets say your home and you forgot what the home work assignment was but you want to ask one of your friends but you forgot their cellphone numbers. What do you do? GO ON THE @CAPS2! At least thats what most kids would do check their facebook myspace, or to see if they could find one of their classmates and figure out what their home work was. An a is way better then the grade you would get if you didn't bring it in. Another good effect computers have is teaching us hand-eye coordination which helps us a lot through our lives. Sports would effected tremendously if you have hand-eye coordination! Imagine you at a football game or practice and being thrown a perfect ball and missing it completely! embarrassing right? Yea well, if you go on the @CAPS2 from time to time you would have that problem anymore.

Computers can decrease give off toxic lavels of radioactive, and is there a chance that we are too dependant on them? These things and more can make computers dangerous. Most, educated people are well aware that doing close-up work fan too long decreases vision. However, most people don't think of this @CAPS3 they use their computers. Many people today are slowly losing their vision because of spending so much time in front of a computer. In a study done by @PERSON1 medical university people who use a computer for @NUM1 hours every day loose @PERCENT2 of their vision ever @NUM2 year, This @MONTH1 lost seen like most, but add to equotion children who use computers almost from and you have a serious problem. By the age of @NUM3, a child who uses a computer in this would lose almost @PERCENT1 of their vision! This situation could got worse as time passess we can only wait and see. Another less known, but possibly dangerous reason that people use computers too much is that computers can give off toxic levels of radiation. Many different components of a computer give off radiation. This includes lasers, and some materials. The risk of getting radiation induced eliments is unknown, but many experts agree their is a significant problem.

They are incredibly helpful things, allowing a person to do research, connect with friends, and have lots of fun!

Without a computer, could you keep up with your friends' lives without being told? could you learn about the fair @CAPS1 people from the comfort of your home? Could you watch an entertaining film made by an anonymous internet user? Computers are the technology of tomorrow and are quite possibly one of the most important things in a person's life. I can't say how many @ORGANIZATION1 I've needed to go to the library for a school project. However, my mother is always working, my brother is at school or work, and my father lives in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION5. There is no one to take me! I've come to rely on computers for many things in life. There are many fantastic sites with a lot of useful information, perfect for projects. Afterall, the internet is a giant library, plus more! I also go to @CAPS2 as a quick reference for a background of a person, place, or item. Just yesterday I was browsing the websites and learned that the island of @LOCATION4 of the @ORGANIZATION4 of @LOCATION1 has people with such strong accents even mainlanders can barely understand them. I would never have known that! Computers also use typing, and most people wish to use them quickly. Hand eye coordination is key and computer encourage the learning of it. There are numerous networking websites - some famous ones are @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION3, and @CAPS4. I, as well as thousands of others all over the world have a @CAPS3. I can see what is going on in my friends' lives with it. I have mee three people over @LOCATION3 who I hold dear. Their names are @CAPS6, @PERSON1, and @PERSON2. @CAPS6 once told me that she is not very social and the only place she feels she can be herself is over the web. I understand this perfectly, so I don't blame her. @ORGANIZATION3 is a website 'communities'; a club of sorts where people congregate to talk, discuss, or share pictures of a movie, person, @CAPS7 show, or author that they like. It is a good place to talk about things you don't talk about with other friends. On the other hand, @CAPS3 can let you connect to people you haven't seen in years. The @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of people on @CAPS3 have met people they haven't seen since five or more years ago with their @CAPS3. Drawing is an important part of my life. I use the programs @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS11 to digitally enhance drawings. Then I past them on @CAPS12 @CAPS13, an artist community that allows members to give feedback on a piece. This help me by letting me see my mistakes, which I then keep in mind to improve. That is not the only thing. Computer games are becoming popular once more, with many coming out for the @CAPS14. Yes, maybe some aren't getting enough excercise, but a responsable individual would know when to stop.

9126,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever been in a conversation with someone while they were on the computer? They are too distracted to listen which annoys you. Well my friends this is the effect or computers taking their toll. With all the people in society that now have computers spend less time exercising, are less, productive/aware, and create bad writing habits. Is this what you want your future generations to become? Computers don't have as many benefiets as you think... take a look for yourself. The first effect I would like to discuss with you about computers is that our society spends less time exercising. Some people say that computers teach hand-eye coordination which is true but their are better, more active ways to learn for example, by playing softball it will teach you hand eye coordination. You would have to watch the ball with your eyes and follow through with the catch. Not only it teach you hand-eye coordination, it also is a active sport skilled with exercise. Also by spending less time exercising it might effect your health. We all know health is very important. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of people who exercise more than spend time on the computer live longer! Without our health our society would be at risk. Another effect computers have in our community is making us less productive. Why use the internet when you have a library full of books? You are @PERCENT2 more likely in find true information in about likely you are on the internet the inland is full of information. For instance, the website @CAPS1 is in false information. On @CAPS1, any could edit the info making it false and the computer instead or books you aren't working your brain. Statistics shows their ages @NUM1 using computers as resources instead of books hall their knowledge doesn't them the section slowly down still not convinced? Finally, my last effect is that computers have a negative effect on writing. How many in your own employees have you seen writing. This is because computers create bad writing habits. An example would be spelling. Now with @CAPS2, texting and online chatrooms young people have came up with a new slang such as lol, ttyl, brb, rotfl, etc. After a while local teachers have noticed bad spelling occurring. Also chatting online is dangerous. They are called online predators. These people you are talking too you sometimes don't know who they are. That is extremely dangerous on the other hand it is much safer writing a hand written letter. Not only is it safe but it also helps simulate the brain and improve literature skills. In conclusion, the computer has many negative effects on our society. Things as simple as exercising, being productive, and literary skills. I hope you know see the horrible effects computers have. Computers can have such a negative impact!",,,,2817,35,481,745,13.7428571429,473,1.28,1,228,0,131,99,46,31,10,54,0,0,0,1,1
9128,1,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 every large business has its own website to either inform or sell to people. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a posotive effect on people. I think that computers benefit society because they provide information, can teach about far away places, and to talk to @CAPS2 or new People. First of all, computers benefit society because they can keep people informed. There are thousands of websites full of information on the internet. Peolpe can now learn by pressing a few buttons and then clicking a mouse. @CAPS1 all newspaper and magazine companies have websites for people to browse online. They keep people informed about local, national, or international news. Important buisnesses that try to keep people informed have websites like the @ORGANIZATION1 (http://www.ushmm.org) Computers definitely keep people informed. Secondly, computers benefit people because they can teach about far away places. News can now travel around the world in minutes. Pictures of so many Places from so many countries can be accessed online. That could be used to tell about natural disasters in other countries. In the recent earthquake in @CAPS3, pictures were shown to get people to donate. Equally important, people can learn about discoveries and inventions that happened in other countries. This quick spread of information is definitely a reason why computers benefit society. Thirdly, computers benefit society by allowing us to communicate with friends, family, or new people. There is a saying that ""@CAPS4 world is getting smaller."" This is because people can have friends all over the world. People can talk to friends that live near them far away from them, or coutries away from them. There are websites made just for people to share ideas and make friends. Equally important, people could take to family that they don't see often. If a person living in @STATE1 has family in @LOCATION1, they can now communicate in seconds. Meeting new people or talking to friends and family is another great thing about computers. In conclusion, computers definitely benefit society. They allow information to spread international events to be researched, and provide people a place to socialize.

9131,1,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, Computers today have an effect on different people in society. It helps people research information 'bout people, towns, cities, states, countries, and foreign languages. But in my opinion, computers have advantages and disadvantages in life. How computers are advantages is that they lets us conversate online with friends, neighbors, family members, and others. But also lets us type reports, essays, and resumes for school, work, or home. For example, say that you have to do a report for financial situations for next @DATE1 but you have to research information on a particular person and you don't have your own computer at home. Do you have to go to a local library and you reserve a computer for yourself. My point is that in society today, computers are advantages, but at the same time, they're disadvantages too. How they're disadvantages is that they take away time from everything, such as recreation, family, friends, and other things in life. Do that's how computers are advantages and disadvantages.",,,,1043,10,173,289,17.3,171,2.84,1,95,0,65,29,11,3,13,22,0,0,0,0,0
9129,1,"Dear Local Newspaper: I do not support advances in technology because it would end up hurting our society of people. This is true because it would mean people would spend less time with their families, exercising, and enjoying nature because of the technology. By the end of this letter you will agree with my opinion. Firstly, I do not support technology advances because it would cause people to spend less time with their families and friends. A week ago I went over to a friends house. Instead of studying for our upcoming french test my friend was glued to her @CAPS2 while I studied alone. In this situation my friend ended up spend less time with me and more time with her @CAPS2, which is exactly my point. Do we really want this to happen? Do we really want people to aside whats most important over a silly @CAPS2? I don't think so. In conclusion this is one reason why I don't support technology advances. Secondly, another reason why I don't support technology advances is because it would cause people to send less time exercising. Over @PERCENT1 of our nation is @PERCENT2 of @ORGANIZATION2 is caused by people technology over exercise according to the <@ORGANIZATION1@NUM1> the <@ORGANIZATION1@NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2@NUM3> @ORGANIZATION1. This percentage also increased over the last @NUM4 years. America is one of the most obesse countries because we are one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world. At first it just started out as a few spots in the country which then spread to the whole country. Before we know it the whole world will be obesse. And once again, we surely don't want this to occur. In conclusion, this is why I don't support technology advances. Lastly, the final reason I don't support technology advances is because it will cause people to spend less time enjoying nature. Everybody has the latest cell phone, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. With all these electronics the popularity of @ORGANIZATION1 activities has decreased. According to the <@ORGANIZATION1>@ORGANIZATION4@NUM3> the @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON1 activities has decreased @PERCENT3 in the last nine months.

Which consequently means that the plants could die which would cause us to because plants supply oxygen. To fly this problem all we have to do is put down the computer mouse for @NUM6 mins everyday and go outside. In conclusion, this is my last reason why I don't support technology advances.

But I think it is a major issue. You, the local newspaper of @LOCATION1, have asked for my opinion on the issue of computers. Here is my opinion: I believe that computers take up less time to enjoy nature, to interact with friends and family, and cause lack of exercise. First of all, computers are a great tool to have but it takes time away from the real beauty in life; nature studies show that people of all ages, from teenagers to working class citizens spend @PERCENT1 of their time on computers instead of the @PERCENT2 they do getting some fresh air! Not only does this statistic make these people extremely boring, it also does some damage to your health! Doctors state that humans that don't get out enough fresh air don't get the right amount of @CAPS2 @CAPS3, which @MONTH1 become a crucial health issue later on. In addition, spending too many hours on the computer @MONTH1 couse lack of interaction with family and friends. ""@CAPS4, I have watched a friend of mine, who happens to be a workaholic, spend too much time on the computer,"" @CAPS5 @PERSON2 of @LOCATION1, ""@CAPS6 isolating herself from friends, she soon developed sighs of depression!"" @CAPS7 you can see, computers can cause more than just unsociable behavior it can also cause diseases such @CAPS7 depression. Finally, computers cause less time for your daily exercise. In a survey of @NUM1 @ORGANIZATION1 citizens, only @NUM2 of them said they get to exercise each and every day of the week. ""@CAPS8's too much to do during the day,"" explains @PERSON1, a working mother. ""Exercising is a very small portion of my priorities."" But, in fact, it shouldn't, since over @PERCENT3 of @CAPS9 die each year by sudden heart attacks usually caused by lack of exercise. @CAPS7 I @CAPS5 before, the wasteful time computers often bring are usually the cause of less time to enjoy nature, lack of interaction with family and friends, and less exercising during the day. It can also cause depression, lack of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and other health problems. So what are the minds of millions of people around the world get turnes to mush?

Say for instance your a doctor, and you come across a disease that you never heard of. Neither have any of your college, so you surf the internet to find out about it. So you can help the patient. What if its another day you have nothing to do, so you go on @CAPS2, myspace, or @CAPS3. To chat with some old friends from college and catch up on some years. tha's perfectly fine! Some people looking at a different perspective, might totally disagree with my idea.They might say instead of going on the internet, to look something you never heard of up. Drop by the library take out a few books and read about it. Due to the fact that some internet sources are not accurate. So you'll have to choose a veliate site. Thats to much work so just go to the library, and take out a book. So summing up my essay I stated why I think computers can be a great source, and why the other side might differ.

9132,1,"Does a @CAPS1 help you out in every day life? I have recently read that people believe this technology is a benefit to society. Without a doubt, I completely disagree with this statement. In my opinion, people have become lazy, the internet isn't safe for children, and this is becoming a tremendous part in issues between families. Computers are becoming one of the top five escuses for why people don't go outside and exercise. Some of the most famous is, ""I'm in a middle of a game,"" or ""I'm trying to beat my high score.""Those are just a couple out of the hundreds people come up with. In other words, computers has become addictive and brain washed all of its victims. I remember a time when my heighbor and I was going to play basketball. My sister said she was going to come out and play once we got done playing a little one on one. We went up the street to see what she was doing. Once we got there, she said, ""I'm not coming out any more I have to beat this game."" @CAPS1 technology has also become a huge issue in families. Now that computers are up to date, it alaws parents to work from home. Some parents might have a full time job and they are never home in the afternoon every weekdays. Now a child is home with siblings or by thereself taking care of the house. This could take away the opportunity for children to participate in after school activities such as being part of a club or sports. With access to work from home parents will to work on. To the child even though parents are have they attention is given to that. Also, the internet has become on to many fatal, @CAPS2 you hear about a child getting kidnapped or of girl getting, then ends up dying. With many children on the internet it is very easy for an internet stalker or to trick a little kid into giving their personal information or having them go to a place very quiet. If children don't know how dangerous the internet can be then they don't know how dangerous some people are. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of all crimes a child and an internet pervert happen because the child either didn't know how dangerous it was to distribute personal information the internet. Without a dobt, I firmly believe @CAPS1 technology has not benefited society. With computers people have become lazy, the internet isn't safe for children, technology contributed to family issues.

9141,1,"Computers are the world's @CAPS1 invention. The question is, are computers good or bad? Well, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS1 @CAPS2 say computers are bad, and I definetly agree. If everything is typed, then there is no history for the people of the future. Also, when people talk online they usually do or say things they wouldnt do or say in real life, and thats not a good thing. And finally a lot of kids are using computers rather than spending time with their brothers, sisters and parents. And when people have no family life, they're more likely to become criminals when they're older. Which is why I think computers are not a good invention. The only way we really know about history/historians is by old documents. We can recognize these old documents by the different hand writing and signatures of the historians. But, with everything being typed up nowadays, every document has the same writing. Therefore in the future it will be impossible to recognize the documents of our time period. When people talk with others online, for some reasons they do things that they wouldn't dream of doing in real life. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 teens say they've done or said things online that they wouldn'y say in real life. When this false sense of security come about, thats when girls send around explicit photos of themselves. Usually they only sent it to one close person trusting them, but that sends it to many others who send it out too. This is called ""@CAPS3"" and can lead to teen humillation, depression, violence, or even suicide. This is a big issue in @LOCATION1 right now which comes from the use of computers. @PERCENT1 of kids who don't have a close family like grow up to became criminals or convicts. When kids are using computers, they skip out on things like family dinner, family meetings, or even family game night. The things that make a family a family. If kids weren't using computers there would be less crime in @LOCATION1. Computers are the root to teen humiliation, depression, suicide, and violence, and the amount of crime going on in @LOCATION1.

Not everyone agrees this benefits society, some experts are concerned about how much time people are spending on their computers. People are begining to spend less time exercising. Some are spending less time with their family and friends. Plus they aren't using any of their time to enjoy nature. Some people spend hours on the computer. They do not exercise, they sit down all day. People who enjoy being online will not move unless nessary. For example: when they need to go to the bathroom, or check the mai, and pay their bills. They will also begin to eat more and gain more weight because instead of using their time to exercise, they are online, chatting away. If they are using all their time to be online, they are not interacting with their family and friends. They are too focused on their computer to spend time with their family. Some people might be too busy with their games or program - to even call their family or friends. But if the person/people are chatting with their family and friends online, they might think that chatting is enought communication for them. Spending all their time indoors, they will hardly get a chance to enjoy nature. Staring at a computer all day, takes them away from the beutiful views of nature. Such as, when the flowers bloom as spring starts, or watching snow @DATE1 or even leaves change during the @DATE1. Computers distract people from their daily life.

9145,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 computers are helpful and fun people abuse them. Spending multable hours in front of them each day. Talking to people through chat and @CAPS3 instead of seeing them in person. And some people using the computer and internet for the wrong reasons. The first thing is that people are spending multiable hours on the computer instead of doing what they should. For example kids coming home and runing to the computer instead of doing their homework or telling their parents they already did it so they could get on the computer. Another reason is that wile spending these out radious amount of time on the computer they block friends and family out, and they aren't exersizing. Nextly that kind of ties into what I was saying before is that people mostly children don't socilize in person with friends and family out side of school and home. Now there is all this stuff like myspace and facebook and even now there is a video card. So children are finding that they can talk to friends with out leaving the house. Also there is @CAPS3 and @CAPS5, so kids are sitting on the computers talking and not going out and making new friends all they can do is send a ""friend request"". And finally we hear about it at the time and hackers one the minds and do bad things. Like get a child to meet them thinking that the person they are talking to is their age. Also people are doing things to computers to get your personal information so they can use it to harm other people. In the newspaper a couple months ago it was talking about how there was somewhere near @NUM1 preators on the site myspace. Kids cannot tellwho the preators are and what they can do. So take this into consideration the next time you log on the computer or even give your self a time limit on the computer it could help you in the long run.",,,,1823,17,338,467,19.8823529412,328,3.62,1,158,0,92,60,17,21,20,43,0,0,0,0,0

You were able to strengthen the relationship between you and your father, see his face, and @CAPS3 brought you two together. One reason a computer can have a positive effect on people is with video chatting and seeing their face. If your friend moves to @LOCATION1 and you can never see him, @CAPS4 problem! Video chat with him @CAPS3's the same! As spending time with him, and you get to see his face. Studies show when two people see each other for the rest time in a while, they will remember certain things about them. Another amazing effect computers are on people is that they strengthen if you can't see your friend every time you want to, your relationship might suffer. However, if you video chat with them your relationship will suffer. The same thing applied for a relative. If they in a different part of the world you wont be able to see them very often. This isn't a problem anymore. You can talk to them online through instant messaging or video chatting. Last but not least, computers bring people together.

9146,1,"Computers have a large effect on society. Yet, some don't notice because using a computer is a perfectly natural device to use. The local newspaper wants an opinion on the affects of computers, and how are they good or bad for society. The reasons why computers have a positive affects are: @CAPS1, communication, and hand-eye coordination. First of all a student will now days will write a paper on a computer document like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. They will do it because there handwriting @MONTH1 be terrible, or they can concentrate better with the words at eye level. Teachers enjoy computers because it makes their jobs easier when they have to correct a large amount of papera. Students also enjoy compueters for schoolwork because they now have more sources from the internet. Computers have a large and very positive affect on society and school because it makes everyone's job so much easier. Second, last week I was talking to my cousin who lives in california on a web camera. I rarely see her, and thanks to a computer I can talk to her more often. Many people will use email, @CAPS4, web camera, and such to connect to their friends and/or family who live far away. Some websites like @CAPS4 and @CAPS6 connect people together by having a computer. It's faster then writing a letter and the message won't get lost because of the weather because emails for example can reach someone on the other half of the country in minutes. Computers now make things easier for friends and family to get together despite the distance between them. Third, for people with lazy eye problem, it makes it harder to do hand-eye coordination. Some exercises are using a computer and it works. Now people who have vision therapy can use a computer to help solve their eye problems. Toodlers have a fascination with hand-eye coordination. Why not, ther a just getting started to use it anyway. A way to teach toodlers about picking objects up is using, yes, that's right, a computer. There are mouses that come in many shapes and sizes, and a toodler can learn how to pick stuff up by using a round mouse and using a special game that appeals to toodlers. Computers can help those who are in vision therapy and toodlers who are just getting use to their skills In conclusion computers have a very large and positive effect on society. it can help teach, help communicate with others, and help with hand-eye coordination. even though the newspaper @MONTH1 have many opinions on the matter most @MONTH1 agree on how important computers are today. Because so much today are run by computers: The cell phone someone's daughter @MONTH1 own will have a computer chip built in, paper that are being written for college are being typed on a computer document, and this paper is also being typed as we speak-err, read on a computer. that is why computers have a large and positive effect on today's society.",,,,2898,27,510,784,18.8888888889,499,3.23,0,227,0,155,84,46,27,21,61,1,0,0,0,0

9150,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently heard a rumor that some experts think that computers make a negative effect on people. I completely disagree. Computers have made many positive contributions to our life including the ability to talk to family and friends online. Another positive effect is the ability to learn about areas far away from where we live. Computers have also increased our country's education. Without a doubt, computers be obviously made a positive influence in our country. Recent technology has forever changed the way we communicate. The type writer, the telephone, and most importantly, the computer revolutionized our methods of communication. Today, the average american teenager on go online on facebook or A.O.L. and talk to their friends in a chatroom. It's that simple. My parents recently went on a vacation to the @LOCATION1. My dad took his laptop with him and every night i was able to video chat with my dad and tell him how's everything going, and he would tell me some stories of the vacation. The only negative i can see in this is me ruining their vacation with me practically there! My final reason on how computers changed communication was the ability to send e-mails. Instead of sending a letter in the mail to a relatives (which takes @NUM1 days), you can instantly see them a e-mail and they will get it the moment you send it. The previous reasons our all positive effects on people and help me, my family, my friends, and my relatives all stay in touch. Have you ever wondered where you want to go for vacation? If you did, than i let you went straight to the computer and up vacation spots. Computers have given us the ability to learn about areas far away from where we are. My family has hooked many online including the @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. We know how beautiful these are if it for the computer. It also saves us time from a confusing telephone to a reservation at a hotel. About a month ago, there a terrible earthquake in @LOCATION3. The entire contry was destroyed. @CAPS2 help food, many and to help repair @LOCATION3. According to a conducted in were from online on a computer. With the help of a computer, of @CAPS1 trusted money and sowed people's lives in @LOCATION3. In my opinion, saving lives and learing details about far away places are positive effects of computers in this country. In modern @CAPS2, the only thing that matters is education. Everybody needs one to go to college. Only one problem, some people can't. My friend was skiing last year and broke his neck and his legs. He was not able to go to school for two months. However, he remaned learning by printing out homework and assignments off of teacher websites. He passed the trimester even when he wasn't in school. Another problem is that some people can't afford to go to college. Nowadays, there are online colleges where people can get an education and degrees without learning their house. More and more people are continuing their grarth of education in or ont of school/college, all thanks to the computer. My previous reasons of how computers changed communication, abled us to learn about areas far away, and increased our country's education are all positive effects onthe world. So the experts saying computers are a bad effect on people, shouldn't be experts.

Pedifiles are on the internet also. Over the internet many at chat sites they talk to children. What comes out of this is child pornography which is illeageal and is like raoing a child through the internet. When children are raped they usually have terrible lives as adults and take out the anger on others. Some even become pedifiles there serves.

Instead of using computers all day long, we should be exercising, playing with our families and friends, and exploring nature. If us kids want to know more about the world then we should be outside of looking at a screen all day. One kind of effect computers have on people is that they are not being able to exercise enough. There is no need to sit on a chair and not being able to get up and @CAPS1 some exercise. Some different people are very lazy, so all they @CAPS1 is eat and sit. Exercising not only puts you into shape but its healthier then sitting around on a computer. I think its better for people to exercise then be on a computer. Another effect computers have on people is that some people are not interacting with their friends and family. Computers are taking away the privalidge of being with family and friends. In my opinion, I would rather be having fun with my friends and family then being on some computer that isnt good for your brain.

With to days economy nobody can afford to pay six or @MONEY1 for a @CAPS6 made by microsoft or even up to two thousand @MONEY2 for a @CAPS1!

I believe in these advances in technology have inpacked the society on spending too much time on the computers, less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. @NUM1 our of @NUM2 students say they go on the computers for more than @NUM3 hours a day. Not only are students on the computers for so long but for parents, teachers, and working poeple. I remember a time when I was on the computer for a long time that I forgot to complete my homework. So spending long hours on computers effect students at school, parents have times when they forget to do soemthing important because of the computers. Computers have also impacked our health, now we have less time exersing. Society has increased the charts of obeast time of people necessary needs. Exersing could be fun with friends and enjoy fresh air. PArents have to help and get off the computers and ride get off the computers and rode a bike with children instead of going on the computer this will help decrease obeast and have more time to exersise. Not onl has computers took time from people and have less time excersing but, the have intefered with interacting with family and friends. At times a family member would stay on the computer eating alone instead of eating with family and be closer, instead its leading in to being unconnected to parents, which could lead to how the act towards friends. At times there could be actions that parents do that lead to write about other friends. which could lead going on the intenet. This could be dangerous and might hurt the other person. But also lead to what friend youwill have. but we could stop this by turning off computers being dinner with them and hanging out with friends instead of writing or hearing things about them that could be not turn. Greenwich time it is up to you to help more nad more people stop using computers so much because it could effect their entire life.

9157,1,"Dear @CAPS1 of the Newspaper, @CAPS2 computers have a positive or negative effect on people? We live in the age of rapid technology advancements and many people believe that computers are consuming too much of our time and are a leading cause of the growth of youth obesity. On the other hand, many people believe that computers help improve learning. Computer companies are now developing software that combines enjoyment with education. Also, computers give people the oppertunity to learn about faraway places and people. In addition, computers improve social skills by providing many oppertunities to chat and catch up with friends and family, overall, computers are an asset to our society, and have many positive effects on their users. Due to recent rise in technology advancements and popularity computer software companies are developing games that combine pleasure with learning. Many of the most popular computer games involve some sort of benefit to learning. For example, the @PERSON1, a computer game where you control people, teaches basic human needs and social skills, because in order for your sim to be happy they must be physically, socially, and mentally healthy, while playing computer games user are taught hand eye coordination and focus. For if you don't have these essential skill then you will lose. Furthermore, computer games bring enjoyment while you are learning. Educational games are great for the student who struggles in school but excels on video games. Perhaps one of the best benefits of computers is the ability to learn about faraway places. Many people don't have the means to travel overseas, and the internet can satisfy their intrest. With pictures, music, facts, and video clips they can feel like they are in the place they desire. Using computers people can learn about other cultures including traditions, attire, meals, and way of life. Finally, many people say that the decline of geographically aware youth is due to technology but in fact it is not, computers suppport interactive maps and other programs that make people aware of their surroundings. Most importantly, computers allow for social communication through chat and webcams. There are many websites that let you chat with your friends. For example, @CAPS3 allows you to chat with your friends, send them messages, look at pictures, and even comment on wall posts and pictures. This will allow for a more socially aware generation because of the constant social communication we have with our friends. In addition many computers have built in webcams so you can chat face to face with your friends. It is like you are in the same room! Neverthless, people still opose computers because ""people never talk on the phone anymore"" and wont be able to communicate throughout life, but this is not true. The time has come for the people to decide if they want to continue the beneficial use of computers or refuse technology. Computers teach through fun and games. Also, they help us learn about faraway people and cultures and they premate and improve social skills. Surely, you don;t want to live like the colonists did hundreds of years ago. That is what will happen if important technology is refused. So get out there and lets teach the world about the numerous benefits computers have on our lives!",,,,3310,30,547,890,18.2333333333,539,3.23,1,253,1,173,96,47,26,28,78,4,0,1,1,1

9160,1,"Dear, local newspaper, I was reading what you had put in the paper the other day, about computers being good or bad. I'm writing to tell that computers without a dout, are good, and smart people would understand this. First, I wanted to say something about an experinse of mine, over the @DATE1, and a little after, I was in @CAPS1 visting family. But I also missed the one I left behind a lot. This problem was easy to solve. I jumped on a computer and started talking to the family I had left behind. Using anything we could find on the internet to talk to one another. One of the concerns was missing out on friends because we spend to much time on the computer. Will let me tell you again, if it wasnt for the computer I would have missed out on everything that was happening back home. So when you think about it, its not bad at all. Second, another reason why using computers isn't bad is because they help us learn about different places in the world. With a few simple clicks I can be overlooking @LOCATION1, then he studing the pyrmids of @LOCATION2, after that to the coldness of the @CAPS2, and finally, I can go to the deep at the ocean without getting a grain of sent in my or getting bit by a krab! All this I can do in the click on my mouse. The best thing is this only takes a couple of minutes compared to the time it would take me to find any of this in a book. Finally, I wanted to talk about the exercise issues. While the computer isn't the best way to exercise, it does teach hand-eye coordination, which is helpful in some sparts. Most of them, when you think about it. Hand-eye coordination is good to because it helps with your time and ask any coach time and having good hand-eye coordination is very, very good. All in all I hope you see the advantages all even the using just one device. Weather you something on the other side of the world, just talking to family and friends on the other side of the world. Having a computer is the smart thing to do, and with todays tech. making it so easy for everyone.

They also help people pay bills on time. If you mail a payment they dont always recieve it in time so if you do it on the computer you don't get charged a late fee because they recieve it in time. The computer is alot faster than mail. When my mom does her bills online they recieve them the next day. My mom hasn't been charged one late fee since she switched to the computer. They also let you do things for school for example, they let you type your reports, look up information, and let you print. I know if i didn't have a computer my hand would have blisters. We do so many reports. This year i have done more than ten, they were three pages typed. They were long. Also, they help when your bored. Say its cold outside and you have nothing to do. You can get on the computer and play games. This way you arn't bored or eating, :) i think that this helps a lot. It improves your gaming skills and they let you be occupied.

The teach great hand-eye cordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places & people, and allow people to chat online with other people. Why would anyone think computers are negative? Computers teach great hand-eye cordination. Many people do important jobs with computers that have to deal with cordination. This help from comptuers can lead to a goo job in the future. Yes, many people say that computers are a waste of time but, actually @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 say they are a great use of time. Computers give people the ablity to do something incredible. For exmaple, e-mailing is an important thing people do on the computer. The computer is one of the best pieces of thechnology in the world! Computers give people the ability to learn many interesting things. You can learn so mcuh from a computer if you really think about it. These are so many unique programs and downloads that help me and you learn! Computers can teach you about faraway places with maps and about famous people with biographys on them. I could understand that spending too much time one the computer and less time exercising is a problem but, if you just balance your time exercising and on the computer you should be just fine. A daily poll from @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 says 28/@NUM1 people wouldn't trade their comptuers for anything because it's so important! They're are so many different possibilities of hwo you can enhance learning from a computer! A computer even allows you to talk with other people online. If you want to talk to your friend right away but they don't have a phone it's busy, just hup right onto the computer and chat with them. The technology these days allows you to chat with people all over the world! People are concerned that spending too much time on the computer means less time interacting with family and friends but really you can talk with your friends online, email your family, and even web cam with friends or family. This feature is one of the best things on the computer. Also many people use computers for typing instead of hand-writing something. I'd rather type this prompt than write it because it's more easier and faster and so would many other people agree with me. The technology on computers is just amazing!

Computers are becoming part of our daily lives. People should use computers because it gives you the ability to learn about faraway places, you can talk to people online, and you can have fun on the computer.

Another reason is they don't go out to there family house or go meet there old friend the only way the could talk to them is by the computer. Exercising is good for your health going on computers all... day is not going to help you cause you need to go outside run, jump, even a walk is good exercise. Instead of being inside the house all day you could be going outside enjoying nature with family or friends.

On the internet you can go to google, type the name of the person and go to any of the places listed. There you would have enough info. to get a good grade. Also, parents like to go on vaction but don't know anything about any place. So they type the name of the place read about it, and book a reservation. The internet is very useful. Especially for research. Many people don't have any cordination. Computers could help you by having websites for typing. All you do is type what is on the screen without looking. After a couple of days and lessons you will be able to type without any problem.

That @MONTH1 be true but ever think of its benefits to help you such as learning hand eye coordination or from youngstars to learn? How about that if youre moving of vacationing somewhere and you want to learn about that place. Just hit the computer. Or maybe even if your best friend moves away and you want to keep in touch? All you have to do is for one second see the bright side and you'll be hooked. First of all i would like to introduce you to the fact that some people don't have great abilitys. So multiple computer games can help them if they needed to get better with hand eye coordination. Some games such as ischool on the computer a hunting your you to be able to look at something and be able to do something with your hand such as shooting a gun or playing baseball. Also if you were say a pointer or a surgeon wouldn't you need to be able to be very small accurate and exact with you work. Well that's what computers can help you with. You could take tutorials for surgery in medical school and get a feel of how you need to be perfect. And for instance my sister needs a computer to sometimes because she has several learning disabilities. She earns and deserves the use of the computer because she works so hard. And this teaches her more than hand eye coordination it teaches like skills. So thats why computers are healthy. Here's another. Secondly say you need to learn about far away places or just a restaurant the. Computers can help with their ability to search places from @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 ect you could learn things you would have never guessed you would learn. Like doing school projects can be done faster and quicker to modern technology, and if also helps you gets the same grades even better. Or if you're going to travel somewhere you could research the places and you could know anything you would want to know just like that. This year my family are going to @LOCATION2 and me and my other sister wanted to learn more about it. So we hopped online and learned all about the and the and it was really fascinating. So you can see how computers benefited us. And to finish up you can talk to people online. I love to talk to people. I just find it fun and fascinating to hear about them and to how they are so i am always talkin to them on facebook and aim. Like my friends usually forget their homework and usually talk to me to see what we had to do because on top of things and always online to help.

9174,1,"Dear editor, I have heard that there is a debate as to whether or not computers benifit our civilization, and I would like to gave my input on this discussion. In my opinion computers are extremely beneficial to our modern society. For example computers help our hand-eye coordination they give us the ability to learn and see far away places and people, and they allow people to talk online together. Today hand eye coordination is one of our most important skils. Nowadays we practically use it for everything our cell phones, our ""gps"" us, Some could ever argue that it is needed for driving. Computers allow us to master this skill and use it. The way we are able to build this skill is by using the keyboard as once you start going faster, your reaction times improve. This has other real world uses too are good example of how hand eye coordination for you to move is by playing basketball for you to move with the ball it is much wasier if you have a good hand eye corrdination. However computers dont just benefit you with some physical feedback, they also are good for your inteligence. A thing that supports this is that you can learn about other places and cultures. Just imagine right now I can go see what looks like and what some people are there. I can also look @CAPS3 and I can probably learn teach about pre @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and what lead to their great rule. Also computers allow you to talk to other people. So contnering with the example above I might be able to talk to an expert or the subject and get a very clear analysis of the @CAPS3. Or I could ever talk with one of the locals about their culture and holidays. You also could get help on your network from the teacher if you cartuset about something. All in all I think that this summarizes my opinion on the subject. Basically just a few things its useful for are building hand eye coordination giving people the ability to learn about distant places and allowing people to talk with other people and those are just a few things it can do.",,,,2023,18,372,557,20.6666666667,362,4.01,1,176,0,89,67,24,26,16,41,1,0,0,0,0
9173,1,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have both bad and good effects, but I am here to tell you the bad effects. People don't get enough exercise and don't spent time with their family, they don't enjoy nature. These are only three of the many ways computers are bad. Much of the young kids spend all their time on computers. This means that kids do not get enough exercise, and they can become overweight. If everyone is worried about people being overweight they have to get off the computer and make better choices. There are so many websites for kids these day they think the computer is better than being active. Without exercise mant kids are not passing the physical fitness test in gym. Most kids don't even want to play sports in gym all they say is I am going on the computer when I get home. Therefore with spending all their time on the computer they never spend time with their family. Spending time with your family can be fun and you can learn things. The most important time of the day is when you are with your family. If you have a problem you can talk to them about it but you can not talk to the computer about it. Yes you can play games the computer but they will be more fun with your family. You can learn about your families history from your grandparents. You can learn to cook on the computer but you can learn hands on at your house. Do you like spending time with your family? If you do you will understand the importance of it. Everyones family should be number one on their list of things to do. however spending time in nature is also very important. Imagine your standing on top of a mountain looking at all the wildlife or your at the ocean breathing in the fresh salty air. How does it make you feel? You can see pictures of the beutiful scenes in the internet, but when you see them in person the impact is greater. When you see a little animal in a forest that will be cut down for a buiseness you want to help it. On the computer you here and read about it but wont do anything about it. That is because you did not see how beutiful the forest and creatures inside it are. Therefore get outside and see it for your self. Computers are good but bad at the same time. They are bad because you don't get enough exercise, yo don't spend a lot of time with your family, and you don't see nature. As you can see computers are bad.",,,,2349,30,454,612,15.1333333333,449,2.06,1,167,0,95,91,27,34,17,56,3,0,0,1,0

My first reason is that they should worry more about see new places in the world instead of looking on the internet. For example go see the rocky mountain instead of looking at the pictures. My second reason is to learn hand eye coordination so you will be able to hit a ball with a bat because you watch the ball hit the bat. A to get out of the way.

Most familys in @LOCATION1 own at least one and they are comeing more and more popular every day. Thir are some people who believe that computers are just a waste of time and money. Your readers need to know that this is a lie! Computers help you get acess to news almost immediatly, communicate with old friends you don't @CAPS4 anymore and are an excelent learning resource. By having a computer with internet acess, you can get up-to-date news with just a keystroke. For example, on most search engine websites like @ORGANIZATION3! or @ORGANIZATION2, there is a news tab where you can find any recent news. In fact, @PERCENT1 of internet users found out about the terrible earthquake in @CAPS1 faster then people who don't have computers. News can spread quite quickly across computers and then be elaborated the next day in an actual newspaper, like this one. Having news at your fingertips is also very helpful because if you want to find it again, all you have to do is bookmark it, unlike the news on @CAPS2 or in the paper. The computer is also a very important tool when you want to stay in touch with old friends. Computer sceptics say that being on the computer keeps you away from friends, but the total opposite. Social networking istes like facebook, help you stay in cotact with old friends that you @MONTH1 not @CAPS4 anymore. If @CAPS3 isnt your thing, then you can always do live webcam which are built into most new laptops. That way you can still talk to old friends face to face. Emailing frends is also a lot easier then phisically writing a letter, which could take days for them to get instead of minutes. Lastly, the computer is fantastic learning tool. By using the internet, you can find many relible resources on what ever you're looking for. Doing a research paper at school? Just pop onto the internet to get a good source on your topic. The computer also helps you learn in the way of games. I know you sceptics must all be thinking, ""@CAPS4, I knew everyone just rotted their brain away on games!"" @CAPS5 thats wrong! There are many educational games that line up with whatever you are learning in school. A good website to find these would be quia.com, where learning topics range from science to spanish. Now really, how bad could the computer be? It provides news, ways to keep in contact and educational help. Readers, you must now relize how computers benifit everyday life in @LOCATION1!

My reasons why I agree is because when people spend too much time on computers, they get less exercise, not enough time to enjoy the outdoors and associating with friends and family. Some people wonder why they are overweight and socialey akward mostly their reason is because since they spend so much time on computers they have less time to exercise and get into some type of shape.Additionally they @MONTH1 be socialey okward because when they're on computers they don't have to really worry about talking to people, ansd so they become shy and kind of to themselves if that is the case Have you ever noticed that when someone spends most of their time on computers, they tend not wanting-to enjoy the outdoors and the beautiful fresh air.

My last and important resons why I fully come is when people spend mostly their lives on computer they to loose contact when their friends and even their family members.

Also spending so much time on the computers you only time to go out with your friends and have some fun with real people for change.

You can play online games that really help you learn hand-eye coordination. You type on computers, and that way you are using your hands and your eyes. Once I went on the computer, I didn't mess anything up because it makes great hand-eye coordination. Second, computers are an amazing way to give you the chance to learn about anything you want. You can look up great vacation spots on the computer. That way is much easier that going and getting a book or magazine on a location. You can search people you want to learn about, instead of watching @CAPS1 or reading book that might have false information. One time, I had a school projects to learn about a person that is a good inflence. I had no idea who to do, so I searched people on the internet and, sure enough, found a good project to do.

Or if you want to find a relationship or a new friend, you can do that easily on a computer once, I couldn't get in contact with my mom over the phone while she was at work.

Without computers there would be millions of jobless people & leave other thousand jobs alot more difficult @CAPS2 it's talking to your unlce @PERSON2 on facebook or typing up your science lab.

The only down side is of course the cyberbulling, bt think of all the positive things about computers. I do believe poeple should go outside, read a book, ride a bike & I do believe people spend to much time or computers, adults should make a schedule for kids of how long can be on the computer & when they should take a break. So twitter updates and facebook status can be.. ""going to walk my dog"" on helping mon with the laundry"" @CAPS2 its chatting on @CAPS3, uploading a video to youtube, checking your friending facebook on myspace, tweeting on twitter, or using a search engine to literally learn about any person place or thing.

9188,1,"Dear @PERSON1 of the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', I have realized that many people are concerned about whether or not computers make for a healthy and good natural life. I'm here to inform you of the pressing issues that computers have influenced on us all. For starters, computers take away from many @CAPS3's exercising and health. Also, they shut people indoors, keeping them from the fresh air of nature. Lastly, many people over the internet interact with children and attempt to steal them away. Many issues are concerning the population today. First, exercising is a very crucial part of adults and kids day to day lives; computers take this away. This is because computers cause an addictiveness to them that make health take the backseat. Being fit is important and many people are too sucked into computers to give a care. Why have your child sitting playing a virtual game when they could be engaging in things that are active. These things include sports which not only provide exercise but can be more fun than computers. This is because, a computer can never take the place of actual fitness. Second, the people of the world have become so absobed in computers, that they have forgotten the true beauty of nature. The world needs to come outside and get some fresh air to breathe in. Trust me, inhaling into your lungs the sweetest thing which is fresh air; that is more statisfying than the greatest video game. Also it is proven that @PERCENT1 of studies show that people who came outside for most of the day are less likely to be unhealthy in adult. So stop being sucked into the computer and go take a stroll through nature. It will not only help your health, but your hapiness too. Lastly, many people interact with complete strangers over the internet. On sites such as: @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6, people put their information and for everyone to see. So when stalkers find that information, they will track you down and possibly threaten your life. Just recently a girl in my town promised to meet someone over the internet. Big mistake; we haven't seen her for almost six monthes. So don't people see this danger? It might not even be you who puts the info on; it could be friends or relatives. Threats are out there, and most are born from a computer. Therefore, computers aren't nesessarily an excellent device to have. They sometimes keep you from exercising causing overweight people. Also, they stop you from seeing the beauties bountiful nature. And they throw your info into cyberspace. So remember, keep yourselves before the computer.",,,,2554,31,444,658,14.3225806452,438,1.67,1,226,1,123,83,33,34,16,60,4,0,1,1,0

Imagine just of a second what life would be like without the use of computers. Children couldn't use them for homework help, some people wouldn't be able to contact other people, special information could not be sent, useful skills couldn't be learned, and the computers. It is quite apparent society releys on computers, and would crumble without them. Computers play a substantial role in the life of children these days. Some even as little as two years old. Modern technology and software in computers has for years been taught and promoted for children. The software allows them access to learning any type of skill, some being hand-eye cordination and the ability to search for information. These skills will help the children prosper and succeed in life. Although computers are a key source of knowlege for children, they are also is extreemlly useful for adults too. Many adults are busy with work and activities all day, and do not have the time to spend reading entire books for work related issues. So the solution in their lack of time is the internet. There they have access to the entire world. Everything they need to know, they can figure out with just the click of a button. Another great use of the computer is it's social networking. Using this, people can contact others and send them important information eficiently. They could also just use it for things. This is a wonderful opportunity for some people. Take the soldiers in I say for example, the use of the internet is the only way they can contact their loved ones. Without it, they would never be able to communicate with families. It is quite clear to me that computers are with much needed in our society.

Also computers don't always have positive effect on people. The reasons why i disagree is because many people spend less time excersing, enjoying nature, interacting with friends and family. I hope you agree. First, many people are spending more time on the computer and less time excersing. Therefore a large percentage of people are over weight, and have bad health. Many people are overweight because they just eat and sit next to their computers. @CAPS1 you can see many people today have bad health because they don't spend time excersing this lead people to be obease. One time when i first have my laptop all i did was just online there the whole entire day. I gain a lot of weight @CAPS1 time pass, about one month and a half i gain about @NUM1 pounds because i didn't excersise. I wil hope you can see things from my point of view! Additionally, i think computers don't benefits that they don't put a positive effect on people. This happens mainly because people should.

Secondly, i disagree with people having time outside enjoying nature this people relevant healthier, open minded, etc. For example many.

If you the computer it to a had with the family. Spending on the computer alsoway of communicating. I think computer is a had every of is because you spend all your time on computers and don't talk with your friends or family. I have known my neighbor for a longtime.

Some people use computer use computers to communicate with family, or friends that live a great distance. People use e-mail, @CAPS2, facebook, myspace etc., because they're all being kept ing touch with people. Many people also cannot afford to go see their relatives because they don't have the money. For example, facebook connects you with people all over the world and still protects your personal information, such as pictures, and e-mail. Some people say that spending too much time on the computer rots your brain, but some people don't even know what your doing on the computer. You could be having a webcam chat with one of your friends from a different counting, city, state, town, but your still keeping in touch. Just because your on the computer for hours doesn't mean it's a daily event, or your not usining your time wisely. For example soccer practice could be canceled or post poned because of a major flood, so you can't pracrice outside. One of your other options, do to the flood, could be using a webcam to talk to your best bud from fourth grade that you haven't kept in touch with for four years. Atleast your being time consuming and making your ""@CAPS3 our soccer practice"" useful by talking to your friends or family. Another possilbe outcome of using the computer could be an excuse from your parents. An example of an excuse from your parent would be them nagging you, like ""@CAPS4, how has she been?""

Also, computers are an easy and simple way to communicate with other people. I feel that computers have a positive effect in many ways. First of all, computers are used in everyday life for both adults and kids. Adults rely on computers for some jobs, and even to help them stay organized. Kids use computers to write school papers, and to look up things they are learning in school. Information can be retained in different ways. The computer, being just one, and possibly the easiest way. Honestly, it is a whole lot easier to go on-line and type in a subject you want, or need, to know more about rather than looking through books loaded with anything and everything. Also, the information your looking up can be broken down so it's simple for you in and exactly what you need. Even though there is a lot of websites to share you have to be careful which ones you are using. There are websites that people can easily go on and change the information, so you should always be careful and double check what you learned. Lastly, computers play a huge roll in communication with . They're many ways you can chat with people anywhere across the world. You can video chat or just talk through a chat site or emails. Sending emails or @CAPS2's is an easy and fast way to tell others information. Of course they're risks, such as talking with people you dont actually know.

Also they're distracting kids from homework, family, exercise, and other important things. This could be part of the reason so many kids are starting to became obese. Computers have also started to become the easy way out of things, which I will discuss later. Now a days people are starting to just sit around on the computer all day. This in not a good thing for our world. Instead of people going out and they are just sitting around staring lot a screen like idiots. Sure there @MONTH1 be some benefits from computers.

Or sitting inside on the computer? I think we all know the answer to that question. You don't need a computer to have fun. Go to the park and play baseball or football. It doesn't matter what you're doing. All that matters is that you're doing something besides staring at the computer screen. If you've got a computer, you've probably got an e-mail. And I'm sure at one time or another we've all filled out something on the computer where we had to give our name, e-mail, and date of birth. Am I right? What I'm trying to say is, you shouldn't give out personal information over the internet. You have no idea where it's sent to. If you don't know where it's being sent to, you most certainly don't know who's looking at it. You don't want somebody you don't know looking over your personal information. Identity theft is a serious issue. And that's just one of many ways it could happen. Doing that could also infect your computer and give it a virus. Be careful who you give your information to. After reading this, I hope you agree with me that computers make you independent, they prevent you from getting out and doing activities, and that your personal information isn't safe on the computer. So why dont get off your computer and go enjoy this beautiful day. ",,,,2580,39,484,693,12.4102564103,483,0.89,0,199,0,94,114,27,33,18,47,2,0,0,1,0

This all leads to, less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Exercising is what I love to do. I love to keep myself in shape and have a good looking, healthy body. Furthermore, loving the feelings I get wile exersising for insted, when I get the felling that I am making a diffrence in me. Theres lots of coordinations I'll be learning with my trainer. However, computer does teaches us hand eye coordination. I have a great feelings of love for nature and you should too. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time using their computers and. Understanding the gift of its kind I do take the time to explor it with family and friends. For example. This believe leads into, how interacting with family and friends is a way we all spend our time.

9203,1,"Dear Local newspaper, I do think people use computers and it has an effect on them. I think the effect is a bad effect because one, it takes away time team enjoying life. Two, it decrease interaction with friends and family. Three, it takes away time to do healthy activities in life. These are reasons of bad effects caused by too much computer time. First, computers take time away from enjoying life. When you use the computer too much it starts to take over your life and then you wont be enjoying life. Did you know seven out of ten people go on there computers or laptops and chat with other people all day. Instead of getting up and going out to see them. Just because you have a computer doesnt mean you have to be on it all day and everyday because theres better things to do. Second, computers decrease, interaction with family and friends. When you are on the computer too much you will eventually stop talking with your friends. Even family members who live with you. I remember the time when one of my closest friends got a new laptop for her birthday, and she found out about this cool chat on her laptop, but once she starting meeting new people she hardly called or talked to me. Therefor her friendship ended with me because she rather talk online with complete strangers than me. Did you know eight out of ten people loose contact with friends and family each year. If you had a computer and you were always on it you could loose the communication in your house hold because of bring in your room on a computer. Third, computer make less time of doing healthy activities. Lets say you had a computer but you liked to play soccer theres more of a chance you will rather stay home and go on the computer because people do act lazy. When you do that your not being healthy and you could possibly gain weight doing it all the time. Also being on the computer takes time away from being outside and enjoying nature. Did you know seven out of ten people have gained weight because of these use of their laptops. As you can see having a computer has a bad effect on you. It causes not enjoying life, decreasing time with family,and takes away doing healthy activities. Everyone should stop with computers and enjoy life, spend time with family and friends, and get healthy and take a jug in the park.

People spend a lot of time on the computer don't realise what's is doing them I mean it could damage your brain, eyes, and most important your personality. your brain because you get a lot of information on the internet and have access if you face your age a lot of info which you should know in school and a lot of information that you should not know until you get over.

You'll start to feel tired, crazy and upset that you can't on back because of your school or job.

But if you see them everyday then way waste your time, go do something with them to see a play ride bikes, see a movie or even see a because if you see them everyday weather in a house or school, even job way spend your life on a computer? I think this should be taken seriously because a lot of people are not going out these days to spend time with family and friends, or events to enjoy nature, sure it gives you the ability to learn about faraway places and people and even allow you to talk to online people but you shouldn't be spending your life on a computer when you see it for yourself outside.

9207,1,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly agree to your statement about how people are spending to much time on the computer and are spending less times excersizing. I feel like after long periods of time the computer becomes addicting to some. Possibly because of a game they are playing, or maybe a chat site that has drawn them in. Many people get bored so they could use the computer as a way to become unbored. The computer can leave you with less sleep of you for to long. Therefore with these setbacks many people don't get enough excersize. Or time to enjoy the real world. I @CAPS2 myself better than anyone else when I say I like to talk. Most kids use the computers as a way to communicate. Nothing wrong with that, but to much talking and you can become very well addicted. Or maybe theres this one awesome videogame but only made on the computer playing a few hours a day eventually leads up to more. Which leaves you inside all the time. When it's a raining afternoon and you have nothing better to do you will sit on the computer all day correct? Though you could be reading, or even cleaning your room instead. @PERSON1 has learned in his study that ""@PERCENT1 of the time people go on the computer for boredom.

9209,1,"Dear Newspaper, The @NUM1 century, also know as the computer age. Many have debated over if the computer is good for humans and human society. I have took the side which state that the computer is good for humans and human society. The first reson why I think that computers are good is because the computer helps with human hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination alows the human to see what they want to do and move the mouse to fufill that comend. Why learn hand-eye coordination? Hand-eye can help the human to control and spice the human body. Hand-eye coordination @MONTH1 help the human with sports such as, baseball. Hand-eye coordination helps the human body to see that the baseball is coming forward the bat. Action has to take place with hand-eye coordination the human body can seize the bat then swing! Hand-eye cordination is usefull with sports and other, reflexive moves or actions. The second reason why I think having computers to benifit the human and human society is computers can help teach humans want to learn about a country like @LOCATION2? Type in ""@LOCATION2"" in a google search engine and find facts like the capitol of @LOCATION2 is @ORGANIZATION1. The computer can also help with learning because it can help children or @CAPS1 with work. These are many ideas that computers will assist humans and the human society. The final reason why the computers help human and human society is that they can talk and see each other online. My family bought a @ORGANIZATION1 computer with a webcam. Now we can see my other cousins in @LOCATION1 by computers. The earth is poulluters deeply, so instead of driving and wastng gas we all can save money by talking online to our relitives or friends.

Someday, you look at friend's request for you, but that guy was not your friend, but you confirm for him, because you wanted enjoy society time. On next day, when you look at friend's request, you have a lot of friend's request, because that guy was bad people, and write your privacy stuff, like pictures, name and something.

9213,1,"Dear local Newspaper, The digital age is taking over human life! As technology progresses every day. People degress along with it. People spend too much time on the computer, playing video games, watching television, and listening or playing on their ipod. It is taking away from our luxeries of life and turning us all into overwight, lazy and disconnected people. We are loosing our minds and our lives are being taken over by computers. Some people don't even realize that they are spending upwards to eight hours a day sitting at the computer or texting on their phones, and this needs to stop. One of the largest problems in society today is obesity and it gets larger everyday. No thanks to computers. We spend eight hours a day sitting at the computer wer we could be outside getting sorie exercise, playing on a sports fear, or just enjoying life. Everywhere I look I see people texting, talking about who said what on facebook, and listening to their ipods. I'm not saying that it is a bad thing, but it becories bad when it is all people do the wholeday. You always hear that obesity is rising, and thats because all we do is sit online doing mindless things. No exercise leads to unhealthiness, which leads to obesity. Another thing that people don't realize is that when they're sitting at the computer, the'y usually grab something to eat too. Again, I'm reaching for an applr to eat, it's usually peotetoe chips of a soda. That's not helping the fact that you're not exercising. Its a double whammy that is turning society into an obese society. People are always saying, ""life goes by so fast,"" or, ""I wish I could slow myself down"". Well, those is one way to slow your life down: @CAPS1 your computer and television and go enjoy life! We spend so much time on the computer that it is just eating up our lives. If we had week of the year that everybody unplugged their computer and got out and enjoyed life, people would not be saying how fast life goes by. People just waste the time that they could be spending with their family or friends reconnecting and having fun. We would have a lot more spare time if we could stay away from our digital devise and cut back on how much we watch television. If you told certain people that they couldn't be on computer for a day. they would not be able to do it, and that's a major problem, and it gets worse ever, single day. A lot of people ask about the future of the digital age. Scientists will definately keep coming up with new devices, but what about the future humans in the digital age? If we keep going at this rate, pretty soon we will loose face to face meeting and everything will be online. All we'll be doing is sitting at the computer all day. I don't know about you, but I don't think I want to have my eyes not out of my lead from staring at a scren all day. In conclusion I really believe that the digital age is amazing, but it is turning society into a sack of couch potatoes, life is too short to be spending all of it glued to a computer screen.

Keeping coumpters is a benefit @CAPS1 will be help by this. They can send email insead at phone calls or type a report so it looks nice. Families will have a much easier time planning parties. They can sent emails or facebook invites. Schools can get breaking news or meeting tmes out faster. They can have a website that has closeing and delays or @ORGANIZATION1 meetings. Me personaly I love my laptop. I can check my email. I talk to a few imporant people through email and it is easier and less expensive then moible web. I take a lot of pictures and don't want to wast my money on new memory cards every time I fill it up. With my coumpter I upload and save all my photos. My mom doesnt want to spend money on newspaper when we get the news and have a computer. Everything in the news is on the computer. I fits my socail needs as well. When i didn't have a phone I would use the house phone @NUM1. Now I use my computer to talk to friends. Also make plans with a computer you can talk to several people at once and it is easier than a phone. Finaly when you make plans to go somewhere yo need to know if it is open. Most of the time you don't know the phone number and stores have websites that have the hours can it.

In the following, I would like to state @CAPS2 opinion and tell you why computers a one of the greatest pieces of technology. One reason why I feel this way is that, computers are needed to do school projects. Computers also offer the endless wonders of the internet. Plus, computers can allow people to talk to relatives in other countries. I am a middle school student so I would know a thing or two about how handy they are for school projects. For example, just the other day I handed in a book report which only took me half an hour to type. On the other hand, if I wrote it, I @MONTH1 of taken at least an hour. Plus @CAPS2 handwriting isn't the greatest, but with a typed report I will not need worry. Next computers can show you hundreds of thousands of things on the internet. For example, say it is a wet rainy day and no one is home. Luckly you have a computer that you can play free online games with people all around the world. Since it is winter out, I can enjoy playing online checkers or a fantasy game with friends. In addition, people can even get important matters finished such as paying bills and banking over the internet. Lastly, people can also talk to family and friends that live to far away. For example, the earthquake in @CAPS3 was a terrible tragity. People would want to make sure loved ones are safe. This can be done via e-mail, web-came, or instint messaging. Also I have a sister that lives in @LOCATION1, which is pretty far. So I can just send her email to say ""hi"". So, in conclusion, this is why I think that computers are so great.

9224,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently heard about your article on usage of computers nowadays. In my opinion computers aren't bennifitting society. First of all I think this because it talkes time away from exercising and enjoying outside. Insted of spending time with family and friends people are just on their computers. And lastly, online people abuse priviledges and sometimes do harmful things. Please continue reading to hear what I think about computers. When you use a computer your sitting at one station continuously. It could be in a bedroom, livingroom, computer room, or even kitchen. No matter how long you spend at your computer whether is @NUM1 minutes, one hour, or maybe three hours, that's time spent not moving your body around. In order to keep your heart healthy and your body in shape you need exercise. Cardiologist @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS2 @PERCENT1 people are not getting enough cardiovascular exercise by the time they are in their @NUM2's."" To exercise your heart you simply need to be moving your body. In the situation with computer usage you are doing exactly the opposite. Do you ever start doing something then look at the clock and wonder where the time went? This happens to alot of people when they're using a computer for person use. The time that went by while you were on the computer is time you could spending time with you family and friends. Once I read an article in the newspaper and a girl who was in highschool and her free time on the computer, creating profiles, writting blogs, talking to people. At night she would be up late on the computer so. By then she didn't have friends her life on the computer. She don't talk to her family. Her whole life, don't let you loose your friends and family to your computer. Nowadays most people have either @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, something like that. These sites are used to connect with, tell how your feeling, or let people learn about you. Although a majority of the people use sites like these right, @CAPS6 are ones who don't, and thats how we start with internet abuse. To me, @CAPS6 are two kinds of internet abuse: first someone you know maybe who goes to your school could be bullying and harassing you. Another way is someone could be stalking you. The computer is a very easy way for people to do this because your hiding behind this screen typing what your saying instead of exactly saying it. This is a very important reason why computers don't benefit society. Within the last four paragraphs you have learned that in my opinion, computers don't benefit society. You don't get exercise when your on the computer. You loose time from improtant people in your life. And, sometimes harmful people are @CAPS6. All of these reasons come once in the same conclusion that computers are not beneficial to society.",,,,2799,33,496,736,15.0303030303,486,2.06,1,220,2,141,99,16,36,16,63,1,0,0,1,0

I interviewed @NUM1 of my friends and @NUM2 out @NUM1 of my friends and @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they think computers gives good affects on people.

Was it help from a computer or not? When you go on the computer because you are bored what do you think you will look up? I know I would look up gorgous spots on the planet. Why do you think I would?

9227,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts that stated that computers are keeping people from exercising. In my opinion, computers help people, but contradicts itself. Computers are drugs or videogames, highly addictive. Jobs or careers that are computer based, limit the amount of exercise a person can get daily. New technology like computers, are the main source to lack of exercise around the world. Computers are addicting. Just like videogames or drugs, computers are highly addictive. The difference, is that videogames mostly attract the young or the male gender; while computers attract both genders of both the adult or young. When playing video games is your hobby, all you do is sit on the couch or lay in bed. Eventually you would start gaining weight. For example, my uncle loves video games. He plays them all day everyday, and since he doesn't have a job and he still lives with his mom he can do that. While he sat on the couch and played video games, his twin sister joined a swimming class. By the age twenty eight, my uncle was obeast weighing from around two hundred fifty to three hundred pounds. At that same time his sister weighed one hundred twenty five pounds. Since he didn't, and still won't exercise, hes not going to lose the weight. They're thirty now and my aunt is still in good shape and my uncle still plays videogames and is addicted to computers. Now he has to walk through doorways sideways. That goes to show people what videogames or computers and lack of exercise can do to you. This being the local newspaper that many people read, I'm sure that about seventy five of you readers, have a job when your on the computer all day. Thats almost as bad as sitting on your couch playing video games or playing on the computer all day everyday. You're not going to get any exercise just sitting at your desk. Its not like you can just get up and start jogging around your building. Those type of jobs limit the amount of exercise a person can get each day. New technologies made most workers even lazier. I would like you to take this letter into consideration for the well being of people around the world. Computers @MONTH1 help most people but it can also stop them from exercising. Not only are computers addicting but they also limit exercise for people that have to work with them. People might end up like my uncle if they continue to choose them over exercising.

Technology acts upon a big part of modern things today such as: cars, television, ipods, computers and exc. Therefore technology does play a big role with how we live today. Computers are a large part of that too. As you know, almost all the schools around conneccticut do use computers. What do you think school would be like without computers? That would be hectic. If you do think that people are spending to long on computers maybe they are checking home work or on the computer doing a project or they needed to go on to write a biography or a famous person so taking/getting rid of computers might cause a decrease in grades. Now that you are looking and reading this article did you know what we had to do to get this article in the news? Yes, they had to type it and they were able to type this because of computers. They had to type very article in this news paper. Without computers for some people would be a devestating thing. For example, you stay out late with your friend and you miss away important sports game on @CAPS1.V. There is two things you could do there: I, go on the computer and check on line or I wait for the computer to print out the newspaper to read all about it. For example, I play and watch many sports @CAPS2, basket ball, football and soccer that is where I met some of my friends. I also met some of my friends on the computer.

For example, you can do research over the computer, talk to people and even improve on your hand-eye cordination. There are so many things the computer can help you research.

My mom, on the other hand, talks to family and friends from all over to keep in touch about  evryone is doing. @PERSON1, my computer teacher always tells our class about how computers help hand eye cordination. I play basketball for my school and basketball takes alot of hand-eye cordination. Resently I discovered that computers can help you improve your hand eye cordiantion. My teacher, @PERSON1 told me typing is a major part in how the computer helps in hand-eye cordiantion. During basketball season I decided to test this thearey, so I would do tests with my coach and type and do games on the computer that help with hand-eye cordination, surprisingly the experiment was proven to work.

9233,1,"To: The Local Newspaper @CAPS1 of late there has been great controversy over whether computers are harming, or helping society. This in itself is a hard question to answer, but @CAPS4 one thoroughly looks at the facts the answer is quite easily determined. It is true. Nowadays people are not spending enough, but can the blame be placed on computers alone? The truth is that computers are noe necessary to continue our advanced way of life, second very many people blame inactivity on the computer, but it isn't the only cause, and finally it has connected the world. The main arguement against computers is the in-activity. This arguement is not air-tight, in fact it is actually quite porrus. The main cause of inactivity is the television, while the second is video games. Although it @MONTH1 be true that the computer causes some activity, you can go out and ask any child which they spend more time on: The @CAPS2, or the computer, and for those who spend too much time on both I truly feel bad for. But on this situation the computer is not at fault, it is the user, the computer is not a toy it is a resource. Video games. The main cause of in-activity among children, I myself enjoy the occational video game, but I know how to limit myself. Computers are more than just toys, they are tools and a tool @CAPS4 used correctly can do amazing things. In life we buy @CAPS1 many @CAPS1 @NUM1 things, and the overwhelming majority of these are made by computers. Origenally computers were made to make life easier not to put a funny video where everyone can see it. Computers are much more important than they are given credit to be the often do things that no human can do, such @CAPS1 calculate @CAPS3 to the ten thousandth number or sense temperature change. They often save lives too, like the tsunami warning center in hawaii, which just the other day saved quite a few people. Computers also build, and create things, @CAPS4 they have the correct programming they could even make another computer. And with that computer you could Learn about the world. Computers are really important @CAPS1 far @CAPS1 technology goes. The main reason for this is because they can correct the world. It is the amazing to talk to someone on the other side of the planet with just the click of the button. The computer is truelly the best thing for contacting others because of its speed. And its ability to keep up to the minute notification on news and other things. But the most important of all is the ability to learn about other cultures, which would have been impossible ten years ago. @CAPS1 the saying goes the gift of knowledge is the greatest gift of all. In finality whether its making fun, items, or friends the computer is amazing. First of all computers do not cause inactivity, you do. Second, computers help us maintain our way life.

9236,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 since the computer has been invented, more and more people have bought @CAPS2-@CAPS3, @CAPS4 games etc, and not enough time exercising. Computers have ruined the outdoors and time socializing because too many people have been on their computers. Computers are great for learning and searching interesting things on the @CAPS5-@CAPS6-@CAPS7 , but computers are not good for playing @CAPS4 games and @CAPS2-@CAPS3. Throughout the year we have either cloudy / rainy days or sunny days. But eventhough the weather might be nice outside, people are still going to be playing on the computer. Playing on the computer takes away time outside, enjoying nature. On a sunny day people and kids are suppose to be having fun playing basketball or jumping on the trampoline. Playing on a computer takes away time outside with friends and family also. Family and friends are the most enjoyable and important possession you can have. And when people are sitting at their desk playing games on the internet, spending time with family and friends goes to waste. On the computer, there are sites that get ""addicting' and you can never stop playing that game for example, www.addictinggames.com is a site that gets very addicting. Soon enough our town @ORGANIZATION1 will be big and fat if the sites that include videogames are deleted. Remember spending time with friends and family is the most important thing you can @CAPS1 have and do, even if it involves exercising. The computer was invented for good reasons like searching the @CAPS7 for interesting topics but now that is no longer true. As far as I'm concerned the computer has interupted exercising and right now, we are getting closer and closer to having an obese country. I'm sure some games on the computer involve sports like football or basketball. So instead of playing sports on the computer, play the sport. Our town of @ORGANIZATION1 is capable of having the best football, basketball and baseball teams in the whole state. And this isn't just for boys, there are as many obese girls as there are obese boys. Obesity is not what we want in the town of @LOCATION1, right? Now is the time to fix the problem, before we create it. The computer has disrupted many things such as enjoying the outdoors spending time with friends and family and exercising. Eating unhealthy foods @MONTH1 olso lead to obesity but not exercising will make it worse.

9238,1,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, I support the reason of having computers. Reason why i say this is because if we didn't have them we wouldn't be able to know how to type up essay's or even how to use specific sites that can help us learn new things. About @PERCENT1 of people will agree having a computer is very helpful. Not only that but, it's very complex to know how to use it. Of course having a computer helps you be entertained because there are websites that you can go on to play games or watch movies. But, the best part is that if you are in school and you have a project that needs up to date information on a state or something, you can get that information really quickly. Also, lets say you need pictures to also go along with it, the computer has a website called ""@CAPS1"" where you can find like a thousand pictures. For example my friend @CAPS2 told me to use a computer image for a project so then i can have details to go along with it. Now lets talk about what it would be like if we didnt have computers? Well, we wouldn't have that knowledge. To be able to know how to work a computer. Therefore, if we needed it we wouldn't know what to do. Also, if people wanted to go on vacation and research good hotels they couldn't because they don't know how to work a computer or they don't have one when they end up needing it. @PERCENT2 of older adults don't have computers because they don't have that knowledge to work and or use one. Therefore having computers is a good choice. Reason being is because, like i said let's say my family wants to go to hawai but we don't know what kinds of activities or what kind of hotel are those, so we go online and look at pictures that tell's us that its a good and fun place to stay at. Plus, what if people have family members that live in a different state and they don't want to make an expensive call? They can always use email to find out how they are doing. To sum this all up, what do you think about computers now? As you can see many people enjoy them for many reasons, since they provide us with many helpful websites to go to.

9243,1,"Dear local newspaper: I am writing to you @DATE1 because I strongly believe that computers are very handy and helps a lot for businesses such as cell phone companies, restaurants / cafes, and it can help you interact with people across the world with one click of a button. First of all, I strongly encourage the use of computers because they are very helpful with businesses. Some businesses that needs computers would be cell phone companies such as verizon, @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION1, and many others. One day I went to the @ORGANIZATION3 store to get my first cell phone and activate it, but I couldn't get it activated because the computers that they used were shut down for some odd reason. A week later I came back when the computers were working and I got the phone that I wanted. Now you see why computers are very helpful with cell phone companies because without the computers, than they wouldn't make money trying to sell their phones. Secondly, I strongly encourage the support for computers because computers can help restaurants/cafes. For example, what if there was a restuarant you have been dying to go to with someone but you don't have enough money for food there. So what you would do is to go on the computer and make sure that the prices aren't too expensive for you and to make sure that the food that you want would be the food that you get. Most importantly, I strongly support the use of computers because you can interact with people across the world. This can be very helpful because what if you had a relative that lived overseas and you needed to talk to him but you can't call because it would be too expensive to make a long distance call. There are many websites that will help you socially interact with that relative such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and many others.

9242,1,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think that computers have a good effects on the people of today. One reason why I think this is because they say that computers teach you hand-eye coordination. They also say that computers give people the ablity to learn about faraway places. For example, if you lived in @LOCATION1 and you were doing a paper on @LOCATION2 instead of using a whole bunch of you could go on to the computer and just research things about @LOCATION2. Another example is that if you want to improve on your hand-eye coordination and also become a better typer you could. Practice typing and that will help you be a better typer and help your hand-eye coordination. Another reason is that they could talk online with other people that arent in the room instead of using the phone to communicate. For example if I wanted to see and talk to a person with out us being in the same place I would video chat with them. Another example is that if one of your family members were in the army and you wanted to talk to them and see how they look you would also set up a video chat instead of just hearing their voice its like your actually there with them. My last reason is that computers are faster and also easier to research things and search and also even shop for things instead of wasting your time looking through books. For example, if you wanted to look for a pair of shoes that you like then you either type in the name brand of the shoe or your type in the name of the store that the shoes are from and then you will find the shoes your looking for. Another example is that if you wanted to see a movie and you dont know what time it starts and you dont have the time to drive up there to check you could just search the movie theater then find the movie then see the time are you have the time of the movie you want. Although people might also say that other people spend way too much tiem on the computer and that they should spend time with family or exercising, enjoying nature and etc. But I say that what if you need do find something important.

Who would rather sit on the couch in the living room watching nothing but the same old episods from who knows when they started, rather then being on the computer? I mean wouldn't you'd rather learn things that no one has tought you befor. Or even create a website or your own idea from ideas on the computer. I know you love chatting with your friends. Well, how els are you going to do that with out a phone. Hellow!! is your brain working today, thats what computers are there for. Don't you love learning new and exciting things. I know when @CAPS1 on the computer, my favorite thing to do is go strait to @LOCATION1. That way any question that I have will be answerd without a doubt as long as I am specific on what I want to know. For example, one time in school, for a @CAPS2 project I had to make a book on @PERSON1. But in order to be able to find facts about @PERSON1 I had to do research. Where do you think I went to find the facts quick and easy? Computer. Is that what you said? Have you ever created anything before or wanted to? Well, I know just where to start the computer. How do you think @CAPS3, @CAPS4, chating, @LOCATION1, google and all the othe websites started. I mean, they didn't just apear by themselfs! Without the computer, our ideas that we have would be pointless. Not only that, but I don't think that people would have such brilliant ideas if it wasnt for the computer which is technology. So if you want to get creative and don't want our ideas to go to wast then the computer is where to start. Don't you love chatting with your friends especially more than one at one time? You can even do this for free and with unlimited talk time. It would be as if you are on a phone plane but the difference is, it's free and you can be learning at the same time. I don't think any other technology devis offers this gift. Chating also gives you the chance to not only chat with friends from far and near, but also meat new friends. So, yes. I do believe that cumputer has a good effect on people. It is good for learning, good for creating and the best way for chating and meeting new people.

9252,1,"Clearly, computers are beneficial to society. Without these woderous machines, how would we communicate with others throughout the world? Trying to get any work done would be much more difficult. Most importantly, where would be in other fields of science, technology, and many others? Computers help us communicate with others, anywhere in the world. One benefit of this is sharing your knowledge with others on a website. Anybody can benefit from that. You can also talk with friends without having to pay extra, unlike cellphones and home phones. Yes, I understand talking with friends can be used to fool around and waste time, but people use this to study together without having to travel to one location. Computers also make things a lot simpler to accomplish things. One example of this is the program, word. This program can make writing that english essay can make that a lot less time consuming and painful. Personally this is a favorite of mine because i don't like writing and I can type fast without too many errors. Another simple, but extremely helpful program is calculator. When you need to solve that simple equation, but you don't have anything, anybody, or you just can't think of the answer, this can help you quickly. You could simply type in the equation, or press the buttons. There are a vast number of helpful programs, that range being simple to advanced. Finally where would be in other fields of science, technology, and almost every job? The movies we watch were made with advanced computer programs. A simple three minute clip could've taken hours to make. Artists who create virtual art need certain programs like photoshop.

9251,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, my name is @PERSON1 and I believe that computers have great benefits to people. They have unlimited access to knowledge about everything. Business can be made easier by computers. Also, computers allow us to communicate with people. All of the factors support computers. My first fact about computers is that they contain unlimited knowledge. Whether you're looking for a recipe of facts about ancient @CAPS4, you can find it on the computer. This is very helpful in schools. Teachers can teach their students more than just the textbook. They can teach kids things abore and beyond to fill their brain with knowledge. Kids can also look up things on their own that interest them. Adults could even do that, too. Nobody knows everything, but comupters can help you come close. Ever since computers were intented, they have advanced the business world. People used to keep records on paper, which was time consuming and it was easy to make a mistake. What if they lost the papers? Well, nowadays thats done on computers. Its easy to type in, correct, change, and save all of the records, and they will be on the computer forever. Businessmen can write documents, send e-mails, and the like to give proposals, speeches, and other documents that are necessary for business. Isn't that easier than writing a letter and ""snail-mailing"" it. Computers have revolutionized business. A third reason why I love computers is because they allow people to communicate. It all star with e-mail, where you could type something up your computer and sent it to someone else's computer instantly. This let distant friends and family members talk to each other without waiting days and paying money for long mailing. Next came the instant messaging and chat rooms, where you can have lengthy conversations back and forth with people. This was good because it allowed people to talk to each other without bieng with them. Now, we have video cameras and video chats where you can talk to and see people on your computer screen. You could be talking face to face with someone one thousand miles away. This lets familys stay in touch. Social networking sights have also given people more time to talk and socialize. Computers can help people get closer and create relationships by communicating. Computers have many advantages. They have superfluous knowledge that educate people. Business has advanced and is more reliable and easier because of computers. People can also communicate better because computers allow them to do that.

Computers are sucking the real joys of the earth from us: enjoying the outdoors, being with family and friends; all has been carelessly thrown aside by these technology monster we call computers. No t only do they create an unhappy world, computers are physically destoying us as well. Studies show that kids with computers are @NUM1 times less likely to get out and exercise than those without. We're creating a generation of lazy children who have spent their time glued to a monitor screen. What good could our future hold if all that's being done is sitting down all day, making our eyes go bad in front of a computer? Not only kids, adults need to get out and give their hearts a workout every once in a while, too! Computers are unhealthy, and must be removed from the centers of our lives. With computers being the only thing that matters to us, Nature has been completely forgotten. Who would want to be outside, feeling the wind in their hair, watching the wildlife at play, with the sun smiling down on them from a pure blue sky? The answer is no one, not when you've got a laptop to plant yourself in front of for hours on end. The beauty of the outdoors is amazing, but only in vain, for computers have dragged humanity into their prison, to vegetate in chat rooms, pointless games, and usless programs. President @PERSON1 agrees, and told the world, ""Technology is great and terrible, and is holding us back from the things we love."" @CAPS1 right he was! Family and friends are pushed back while we choose instead to talk to complete strangers on the computers! NOt only is this dangerous it leads us away from those we love. Some argue that emailing and instant messaging are fine for talking to family and friends, but whatever happeneed to speaking to one another face-to-face? Sometimes our best friend is someone we've never seen, only talked to on a computer. This behavior is harmful to the realtionships we've fromed without the help of technology, and is harmful to our world.

My friend @PERSON1 used to spend all her time on the computer. I didn't get to see her much, she just went right on home and on the computer. She stopped spending daily time with her family as well.

This is because it helps us with work, help us connect with friends, and gives us acess to virtually any knowledge we need! I am writing this letter to prove that the computer is a good thing. The first thing I'd like to tell you is how you can meet old or new friends. I'll tell you a little story to get us started. In @NUM1 grade, there was one girl I could not stand.

Don't you miss your friends? I know I do. Another reason why computers are positive is that they are used for work frequently. Have you ever tried doing your work without a computer to do it on? Computers are faster than if you do it by hand. You can also print copies, so you don't have to type more than one. It is even possible to make copies of those copies! Wow. Very cool. I know all this stuff can get pretty confusing but its totally worth it. There is a computer designed for work! It is very expensive. But it's portable, so you can bring your work almost anywhere.

9264,1,"Some people think computers benefit us, some do not. In this paper I will be talking about how computers can benefit us. First off, we can learn about many people, places, and things via the internet. Next, we can go shopping online. And finally we can use the internet for entertainment porposes. In summary, we can use it to learn, boy things, and to entertain. The first thing i'm going to argue about is how we can learn on the internet. If you go to school, you will need to research a topic @PERCENT1 of college seniors use the internet to research things they need to do. We can also learn about other countries. Many tourist use the internet to find out interesting facts about places before they go there. Finally we can learn about the past, for example, we can learn about the revolutionary war, or why the eiffel tower was built. The internet is full of facts and interesting people and places. We can learn about. The second way computers can benefit society is by shopping online. For example, you can purchase things not available at your local retailers, like place tickets, computers, video games, you can even but auto mobiles! You can save up to @MONEY1 worth of gas just by ordering something online instead of going to a distant store. The internet also has auction sites where you can buy things for less. Another way to save money by shopping on the internet. In summary, we can buy special items, save money and go to or host auctions on the internet. Finally the last thing I'm going to argue about is how we can entertain ourselves by using the internet. If you are in a traffic @CAPS1, you can pull out your liptop and play games till the road is cleared, but remember always pay attention to the road. If you are waiting for a plane, you can listen to music or watch a movie until your plane arives. If your on a long bus trip or a boat cruise, be sure to download music or games to play.

9266,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I agree that computers do benefit society. Look at all the good things we can do with this device. For example, computers teach hand eye coordination. Also, it gives you the ability to learn about faraway places. Lastly, why use a phone when the computer lets you talk online? The computer benefits us and helps us learn. First, people who use computers learn hand-eye coordination. Most people play video games which involves looking at the screen and not the controller well. A computer can give you typing lessons and it helps you memorize so when you play the game you already have the picture of where the controls are. If the computer didnt do this, then what other device would? Secondary, our ability to learn about far away place is much more accurate. On the computer, there are many different websites you can look at to find the place you would like to live or vacation at. The computer also gives you maps so you could find that far away place without maps, who knows where they are going? The ability of learning about far away places has to do with research. Your research would be more than @PERCENT1 if it's coming from a computer. Computers benefit society more than you think. Lastly, the computer gives you the ability to talk online. Why use a phone? on the computer, they have things like video chat and webcam. With these inventions, you can see the other person and talk to them as if you they were right in front of you. If we didn't have computers, we would be right back to house phones and running up cell phone bills.

I feel very strongly about computers and up-to-date electronics beacause they give you a chance to talk to people of different cultures learn more the people your living on this earth with and also learn more about yourself where your culture was originaly from ect*. My second reason why I support up-to-date technology is because they have many educational effects! like many people are home schooled as you @MONTH1 know. Also even if you aren't you can go to websites such as @CAPS1.com where my school goes to review questions befor a quiz. Which helps all the kids a lot. Also you can google any question about languages, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 studies ect* you will find an answer I can esure you.

I have cousins and freinds in @LOCATION1 that I don't get to asosiate with very much, therefore, I use the internet to speak to them when I want to. Did you know that one of the main reasons that computers were made was for a faster way for research? @PERCENT1 of the internet is taken up by research @CAPS6. If you are at home and need to complete a research project from school you can use your computer. If you don't have one you can always go down to your local library to use the computers there. I do not have a computer at home if it physically unable to be operated with, therefore, I use my cellular device because I have internet on my phone.

Maybe, if there is a traffic jam on your way home you can check to find a different route. To me, computers are an important part of our lives. I think we should show appreciation toward the men that invented it. I don't know how its possible for a small thing to have so much things in it like all the @CAPS6.

9274,1,"Dear local newspaper, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on effects computers have on people. Computers have effects on people because people spend too much time on them, keeps you from going outside, and it sometimes it gets boring. Thats why I think that computers have effects on people. To begin, people spend too much time on computers. For example kids play games on them until they finish the game which would take them about @NUM1 hours. Also people chat with there friends for a long time every single day. People and kids can not go with out a computer or a laptop for one day without spending hours on it. That is one of the reasons why computers have an effect on people because they spend too much time on them. Moreover, instead of staying inside all day on your computer why don't people come outside and enjoy the weather. If the weather is warm go outside hang around with your neighborhood friends and play soccer, basketball, baseball, and lackball. If its cold outside go out and have snowball, go sledding down hills, and ski or snowboard, whatever the weather is like go outside instead of staying inside and waist your life on a computer. That's another reason why computers effect people because people need to enjoy the outdoors. Furthermore, sometimes the computer gets boring people and kids still stay on it even if they play the same games over and over again. Also kids to watch the same movie clips over and over again. You know toughs really funny clips after a while they really are not funny anymore they just get boring. Some people just go on the computer and do nothing now to me that sounds boring don't you think? That's my final reason why computers effect people lives because they are sometimes boring. In conclusion, those are the three reasons why computers effect people's lives, because it waist perfectly good time, you are always inside and not outside having fun, and it sometimes gets pretty boring if you ask me. Thats why people should yet off there computers and have fun outside.",,,,2043,19,365,523,19.2105263158,362,3.62,1,157,1,95,69,13,34,17,54,0,0,0,1,0

I think this is true because my first reason would be it is not good for your eye sign just to sit there for that lond period of time. Also another reason why it is not a good idea is because people that sit on the computer day in day out they just gain weight. My next reasoning on why it is not a good idea is because when you are sitting at a computer you are not getting anything good out of it like excerising that is very important but ,it is not good to not ecerise. And also it is not good because if you sit on a computer then how are you bonding with your family at home that can cause alot of problems. Then here is another way to look at it if you sit on a computer allday then that means that you are not excercising your heart which is bad to. And another way that this is not good idea is because when you sit around you become lazy and not wanting to do any house work or anything outside.. But some people also sit on the computer very late not doing anything very important when they should be doing things around the house that is important. But that is not all some people would rather sit in the house all day just to stay on the computer. Rather than just going outside for some fresh air. And my next point is that a computer is very addicting top some people it's like when they get on the computer they don't want to get off. Find that can be a bad thing especially if you do some kind of sport. And lastly a computer is not a good idea because it seem's like once you get off the computer you just want to get right back on it which happens alot in some people's case but they just can't help it because they are just to addicted to it.

An average @CAPS2 teenage spends @NUM1 hours a day watching t.v. when they could be playing football, baseball, hockey, outside with their friends.

Now with the @CAPS4 and new video game being developed their addictions toward technology will increase. Electricity is one thing that people can't get enough of now adays. We pay for electricity so that we can use it for everthing. With the new developments in technology computers need a whole lot more electricity to run. They need more electricity because they have such complicated circuits. If you had a @NUM3"" flat screen t.v. and a @NUM4"" screen t.v. which one would require more power to use? The @NUM3"" because it has a bigger screen therefore needs more electricity to power it. This will then added to how much t.v. kids watch and you are using a lot of electricity for one household object. Humans are always looking for somthing better and bigger.

People are spending more time at a computer rather than exercising or spending time with their familys and friends. Cyber-bulling and online predators are major internet threts that inocent people encounter everyday because of too much computer time. Computers are ruining good peoples lives perminitly. Computers really have a negitive effect on people. Take my friend @PERSON5, for example, she was a star athlete in lacrosse and hockey and was always active in some way. However, when @PERSON5 recieved her first laptop last year, it slowly began to take over her life. Instead of going outside to practice, she @CAPS3 sit home on her couch and surf the web. She ended up quitting all of her sports and staying home on the computer day. She started leading a very unhealthy lifestyle and got classified as obese this past winter. This is a very sad story and it really does show how a computer can and will negitivly effect your life. @PERSON1, a very well-known doctor, was recently quoted saying, ""Computers are the downfall of our generation. They ruin lifes and too healthy people into lazy people. I cant tell you how many kids I've seen become obese because of too much computer time and not enough exersise. It's so sad."" @CAPS3 you want to end up like my friend @PERSON5 or the thousands of other obese americans because of a computer? Computers can also negitivly effect peoples personally lives. Take my cousin @PERSON3, she the most girl in school who loved hanging out with friends and family members. However, when she get to high school she started using the computer more and more. She soon seemed as if were out with her friends, her grades segnificantly dropped and she stopped talking to her family. Her whole life was overtaken by the computer and it completly changed her as a person. It's so hard to watch this happen to someone you love. But you should know that @PERSON3 was not the only one who this happened to over @NUM1 american have been completly taken over by the computer. Scientist @PERSON5 recently conducted an experiement with computer usage and got some sheering results. He said, ""People become like addicts with the computer and they just cant get off"". @CAPS3 you want to see you or someone you knows life get ruined because of something so silly such as a computer? Lastly, computers can effect people but exposing them to cyber-bulling and online predators. My dearest friend came was just like any other middle school girl in the country and like most people she had a facebook one day an older high school girl started bullying @PERSON4 online to the point where @PERSON4 fell into depression. One day she decided it was too much and took her own life. Her family and all of her friends, including myself, were so disterbed an heartbroken over the whole situation. As you can see, cyber-bulling is a real danger and can potentially be life thretning. A recent study showed that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 kids admitt to have taken part in cyber-bulling before @PERSON2, a detective said that @PERCENT1 of teenage suiside is due to cyber-bulling. Do you really want to be exposed to theese serious dangers? All in all, computers can seriously effect you in a very bad way.

So I changed @CAPS1 computer time and started hannging out with friends. Now I see them alot more. Remember life is not being on the computer alot, it's about being with family and friends. Don't forget about your family and friends. Did you know that over millions of people are overweight? I bet about @PERCENT2 of millions overweight people are involved with the computer. It's not good being overweight. It could lead to many health problems. Not just only health problems but death! Please don't lose you life by being on the computer and being overweight. I wouldnt want people going over weight by you being on the computer so much. When @CAPS1 cousin was on the computer @NUM2 she saw herself gain weight. Please dont do this. As you can see being on the computer you use up your life. Losing your can lead to problem. It can lead for you to have no friends or just being alone. Life is not just given to you. If you wand a good life then dont be on the computer so much. You could be doing so many different things instead. I had noticed that when I used to be on the computer I saw life going by very quickly and I mean it. Dont forget computer can ruin you like not spending time with friends and family, you could be overweight and life goes by quick. I hope you consider @CAPS1 opinions.",,,,1896,29,359,493,12.3793103448,346,0.89,1,138,0,91,83,17,29,16,48,0,0,0,1,1
9282,1,"Dear newspaper I want to write this article to you saying more and me people use computers some people people say it's ok to use them because it helps you do lots of stuff like finding information about different places in the world communicate with people around the world and more. but some people think that people use it too much and don't do enough exercise. I think that it's all to use a computer everyday but not that much. My first reason why I think we should use computers is internet that's the place where you can find most of the information you want to find. You can find anything in there like information about different palces around the world, you can find anything there, cars, recepies, games, space, information for your business and more. My second reason is communication, @DATE1, you can communicate through internet. And millions people. All arond the globe most of the kids have to and everyday kids go on facebook @CAPS1 they send messages to play games fun for people to do that why most of the kids go on internet because its just fun for them. My thirds reason if information @DATE1 you can actualy won't classes in school with for homework you have to write a paragraph on or research like a from sciences or social studies. Also you need for your projects or when you need to write an essay power points and people these can't live our. so in every I think people should use computers because they use it for any like finding information, homework, communication and a lot more computers are fun for people.",,,,1540,11,282,410,25.6363636364,277,5.96,1,127,0,79,46,13,14,13,39,3,0,0,0,0
9279,1,"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently become aware of the debate regarding the effects of computers and the internet. I strongly support the influence computers have on society today. Computers not only effect the medical world but they effect the economy as well. Computers also effect @CAPS8 education. My initial reason why I support computers and internet is that they can effect the medical world. Imagine you are on a trip in @LOCATION1. You get hit by a car and you are severly injured. You do not have your medical records and you have a metal plate in your head. The doctors in the @LOCATION2 send an email to your doctors in @LOCATION1 and they are informed of the plate before they do an @CAPS2. Computers just saved your life. Without computers or internet you would have been given an @CAPS2 and the plate would have been pulled out of your head. My secondary reason why I support computers and internet is that the internet opens up new opportunities for @CAPS8 to learn. The internet can help @CAPS8 research for projects, labs, tests, and @CAPS4.A.T.'@CAPS4. Last year my class was assigned an essay at the end of the year. The subject was to find a way for the @LOCATION2 to lessen @CAPS5 casualties. We were given time to research our ideas. I had no clue what to write about but after I researched a little on the internet I decided to write about privitizing the @CAPS5 because @CAPS5 contractors have been proven to be more effective than enlisted soldiers. I was the only one in the class that used that idea and I recieved an ""A"" for the essay. Every last piece of information I used was found on the internet. This shows that the internet not only gave me an idea for an essay that I had no idea what to write about but it also gave me all of the evidence I needed to support my idea. This could be true for many @CAPS8 around the world. In addition, @CAPS8 can learn about far away countries easily. Unlike before the internet was invented. Back then, you either had to read an entire book about the country you were studying or actually go to the country itself. My final reason why support computers and the internet is that they can effect the economy. In these hard economic times the @LOCATION2 is relying on the internet to help stimulate our economy. The intenet can make people money and can also help people find jobs. Both of these things are crucial to the economic recovery of our country and are made easier by the internet. Many people buy and sell things over the internet. In fact, forty percent of all trade is done through the internet. This alone could effect the amount of time it takes our country to recover from our current recession. Also, in order to use the internet, you have to pay. This could help some companies get out of the red zone. Internet plays a very large role in our economy. In conclusion, computers and the internet play a very large role in our lives. Medical disasters can be simply avoided if medical information is transfered through the internet. @CAPS8 can be given ideas and supporting evidence for their school work as well as learn about countries quicker and easier than ever before. In addition, the internet can also stimulate the economy by making people money and finding people jobs. These are all positive outcomes that can improve our country greatly.

They teach hand-eye ccoridination give people the ability to learn about farther distants, and allow people to communicate with one another. Therfor, computers do benefit society. Hand-eye coordination is something that every individual should learn. Wether it is typing or knowing the problems a computer has, or even just knowing how to use it. @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 of people say that they rather have spent more time learning to type and becoming faster when they were younger. People say it gets frusterating and they just want to type fast. And it would be much easier for work or if you had to type something for school. The move practice you get when you are younger the better the success whenolder. Practice makes perfect! Don't you ever get haved or learning about your state or city or even country? I know i do. Thats when you can use the computer to learn about different countries or states. If we didn't have much use of computers, when were going away how would we know what it looks like or whats to do here? We wouldn't so computers can give you the ability to look at different places and learn more about them you don't know anything. Therfor, the more computer time the more you learn about the world. Computers also give you the ability to communicate with other people. You can be neighbors or talk to a family member or a friend across the world. You can emial, facebook chat, or instant message one another to talk or if you need help with homework or just need someone to talk to be you cant w/ your parents. If you live across the world and cant aford to day for more minutes on your phone then you can just chat them on the computer. They have more techonialgy and invented webcams so you can even see the person and talk computers are very useful for dancing.

9284,1,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you spend hours on end on the computer? Most teenagers are having this problems, these free time is being used on the computer. Although computers help @CAPS3 @CAPS1 school work. They are causing a negative impact on society for the reasons of kids health, distractions, and effecting family time. Firstly, kids health is being effected. This is because instead of going outside and playing sports like basketball or dance, they are going on the computer talking to freinds or playing games. Although, this helps there social life it is causing a lot of damage to there physical health. For example, instead of getting active and burning off caleries, the kids are sitting at a computer pretty much doing nothing. This is causing doctors to get concerned about the obesity rates and weight goals. Doctors say that ever since laptops and computers have become popular that now @NUM1 kids are getting in the obesity area. They say the reason to this is because people were more active in years past. We want this health risk to go down so computers are causing negative impacts. Secondly, computers are extremly distracting. There are so many more websites, games, and chat rooms, that trying to get homework done is taking more then twice the amount of time it should. @PERSON1 a student at @ORGANIZATION1 expresses to us that ""A big distraction is facebook, I could be on these for hours doing nothing. Its really effecting my grades are trying to get all my work done."" A poll was taken, it was on how distracting @CAPS1 you think computers are, @NUM2 @CAPS3 said that they are very distracting and sometimes you just want to throw them to make them stop. Especially with the work load, you dont want to be distracted. Once you start a website like myspace of twitter it would take so much effort to stop. It really is addicting. @CAPS3 are getting a very hard impact from computers. Lastly, family time is being questioned. Families all over the world are feeling heat from there teenagers being sucked in by the computers. Even, how hard it is to get them off to just have dinner as a family. Causing the families emotional state to be questioned. Kelly a sixteen year old girl says that before I got a computer on my thirteenth birthday I was social and cool with my @CAPS2. My @CAPS2 said that they have seen a change in my behavior. ""@CAPS2 are starting to wounder if technology is coming around for the good. Almost, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 say that they dont spend nearly enough time with there kids. Family time is being, limited and getting @CAPS2 concerned with these kids well being. In conclusion, computer are having a bad impact on @CAPS3 especially because there health is at risk, there are so many distractions when trying to get work done, and family time is being limited.

9283,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Are you tired of technology? Are you concerned about your loved one using the computer to much? If you answered yes to all these questions, then you to agree that computers do not benefit the society. In my opinion computers have a bad effect on people because more people are spend time on the computer than they do exercising. Also, @LOCATION1 has such breathtaking nature but no one takes the time out to enjoy it. Besides this, the effect of the computer has even effected interaction with ones family and friends. So now if you please read on I will be happy to tell you more about how computer effect people. Have you ever wondered @CAPS3 so many people travel to @LOCATION1 each year? The government states that every year at least @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who are traveling to @LOCATION1 came to mostly see @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 nature. But the sad story is that @CAPS4 @CAPS2 rather sit at home on the computer than than enjoy the magnificint nature that @LOCATION1 has to offer. You might be wondering how I know that @CAPS4 immagrants come to @LOCATION1 to see nature. Well, my uncle from @LOCATION2 wanted to come from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. I asked him @CAPS3 he came and he said, ""@CAPS3 I wanted to come enjoy the nature here."" @CAPS4 people though just like to sit at home on the computer. This technology has made people really lazy. A recent study shows that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people that were nature lovers now traded there hiking sticks for computers. Now this isn't good at all and shows hwo computer affect people. @PERCENT1 of people that exercised daily are now saying that they rather spend time on the computer than excercise. Now people have become so busy with the computer that they say they don't have enough time for excercising. For example, people can now do anything on the computer from watching movies to playing games. This has caused people to forget about the world around them. Besides that, if people dont excercise and spend their time on the computer the obesity rate might go up. Even @PERSON1 says ""that the obesity rates are starting to rise as more and more people start to use the computer. For example every time a person eats they need to do some type of physical motion before sitting down. But peopel that use the computer are now just eating and sitting right back down so they can use the computer. Now this is mad if you ask me. Yes I know the computers helpful but it also is helping make sure people dont excersise. Isn't spending time with your family and friends important? A research study shows that @NUM3 out of @NUM4 @CAPS2 have stoped interacting with friends & family since the computer came out. For example many people have stopped going shopping with there friends because they can now shop online. This makes people even more lazier because now they can things online so they dont even have to get up. Yes over though this is easier it also makes many people less interactive. Besides this, many parents are setting bad example to their children and teens. Our furture workers are now starting to use the computer and became less interactive as well! This isn't good at all, and this reason @CAPS3 comperters effect people. As you have read you can tell that computers do have an effect on people. In my oinion computers are bad because people spend less time excercising and more time on the computer. So now stop what your doing and on stop these computers that one taking over over nation as we know it.

Another reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people is typeing. The reason why I say this is because when you want a good job that involves computer you'll have to no how to type. I know this because when your in a busines you wont wont profiles to go down just because some wons not typeing in what is need to be done would you? I knoe I wont. My third specific reason is news information. Some people miss the new so they go watch it on there computers for instence people need to know what goes on so if theres and disease going on or if a bad oil spill.

One reason is that, many young children spend their time sitting around on computers, when they clearly should be out having a good time, doing active things, with friends. This can cause children to lose interest in exercise and do nothing but sit around all day playing games, becoming obese children! I believe that children should be enjoying their childhood out in the neighborhood playing! Another very important reason that children should not play on the computer is that, computers can cause serious health problems. Such as, eye problems, or even strokes and heart attacks! The reason being that many games or online shows have flashy bright lights, and loud annoying sounds. A @CAPS1 can become disoriented and fall to the floor. This happens because, whe nbecoming disoriented, a shock is sent to the heart from the heart from the brain and it puts you out for a minute or two and you @CAPS2 see a medical professional. Now, you don't want little @PERSON1 or @CAPS3 to be hurt do you?! Equally important, computers promote bad things! Such as, inappropriate language, and dirty videos. Many people have a facebok, or a @CAPS4, or even a @LOCATION1. These websites are just plain, @CAPS5! Too many bad people are on the prowl looking for nieve girls, boys, and even @CAPS6.

They're like little children, they get viruses and need to see a professional every once in a while. This can cause, costly bills and many hardships. Last but certainly not least, there are people out there who are absolute and complete hermits! All they do is sit on their bottom's and play comp. games, like world of warcraft, and runescape.

9293,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers can have a huge effect on people. I believe that computers are decreasing the chance on people to do many things. First of all, they spend less time excersizing. Second of all, they should be out enjoying nature. Lastly, they spend less time interacting with family and friends. After through exploration of these arguements most people will likely agree. First of all, people might be spending too much time on the computers and not excersizing as much. Excersizing is very important to the human body. It can keep you healthy and you can burn a lot of calories. If we don't get the excersize we need, things can go wrong. For example, my @CAPS1 had a lot of etra fat is bad because it can cause diabetes. We really have to keep our bodies heathy, but computers won't be able to do that. Second of all, people are stopping to go outside and enjoy nature. It is very nice to go outside and brethe in the fresh air. Most people rather prefer to stay at home and sit in front of the computer. They are missing the beautiful things in life. Nature is something so naturally beautiful. Just to sit outside on a warm, windy day can be so relaxing. Starring at a computer for a long time will not do you any good. People should really enjoy nature because it is free, beautiful, relaxing, and breath taking. I really don't want computers to make nature become non important. Lastly, people are so focused on the computer that they forget about interacting with family and friends, family is very important. They are there in the good times and bed. People are choosing a computer instead of important people in life. The computer are ruining the minds of others. For example, I used to have a best friend that can be on the computer for hours. If it wasn't video games, then it was chatting. He wouldn't even go out with his friends anymore and just started to throw us away. This is why computers are decreasing the chance of doing fun things in life. In conclusion, computers have a log effect on people. I believe that they can be doing so much more in life rather than sitting in front of a computer. First, people don't excersize as much. Second, they spend less time enjoying nature.

How many times have you used the @CAPS2 to find new information about something you have no idea about. Well I have used it many times and other people have to when you have a project and it is on something you don't know anything about you can go on the @CAPS2 and look up what you need to know. So when you think about it I am pretty sure that computers have helped you more times then you could ever think. So @CAPS2 can really help you. @CAPS2 can also help you pick a place to go on vacation and you can also learn stuff about the place you are going to. I know when I went on vacation we looked on the @CAPS2 to find out all about the place we were going to. It can also help you find restorants and stores and sight seeing place - you can go and see on your vacation, I am pretty sure that when you go on a trip you look up information about the place before you book the trip and just go to that is mainer reason why people use the @CAPS2. Another reason why people use the @CAPS2 is because many people are learning it language. Many people that came here from, different countries need to learn the language of the country. The @CAPS2 has many programs to help people learn a new language. Many people learn a new language by the @CAPS2 and the @CAPS2 teaching them new thing and how to speak the language. So the @CAPS2 is also good for that because many people need to know a different language know a days. So I think people are doing good by being on the @CAPS2 because they learn new things and learning new things can be good. So I think the usage of computers is a really good thing. So next time you need to know something think about using the @CAPS2 because I am really sure that anything you need to know would be on the @CAPS2.",,,,2188,21,423,558,20.1428571429,421,4.01,1,130,1,103,93,36,23,14,43,0,0,0,0,0
9296,1,"The effects computers have on people vary from person to person but overall they have the general same effect. The things that is a most common effects is it teaches Hand-eye coordination. Advantages of computers are you can learn about places and/or people, and you can talk with people. Hand-eye coordination is an effect from computers. One advantage is that people can type faster. On average @PERCENT1 of people said that they have been able to type faster. This is a result of getting a feel of where the keys are and being able to look at the screen and type. Hand-eye coordination also helps with people being able to multi task. An example of multi tasking with hand-eye coordination is being able to talk to somebody and type-up something at the same time. An arguement is that computers take away from sports and exercise. But my friends said, ""I'm a goalie for my soccer team and having hand-eye coordination has really improved my skill. I can stop more soccer balls than I did before"". Therefor, it realy doesn't take away from sports because in most sports you use your hands. Another advantage about computers is that you can talk with people. Talking online is an advantage for some people who might not have a phone. Also talking online for maybe an hour or more is better than talking on a phone for that long. For adults who had lost tosch with old friends from growing up, can connect with them. This lets them catch up and re-connect with each other. Most people think that kids use computers for useless things. Kids don't really, in a survey @PERCENT2 of people under the age of @NUM1 said that what they do on the computer they find it to be productive. Most of the things are for the school. On the computer you can learn about places and/or people. When people look in a book about the place they want to learn about, more than likely it won't be as updated as a website would be. Also when they are looking for a place the website might tell them how they could be able to visit that place. Computers are a good thing because it teaches hand-eye coordination, you can talk with people, and you can learn about places and/or people.

Your need a lot of friends in order to have a strong self asteem. You can also find out if you have any homework or any important news from your friends online. Learning new things is a good thing in life because than you know a lot more than you did before. The computer will answer any questions you have about life. It will also give you biographys of famous people if you need to work on a school project. The computer is also good for typing school essays, so that they are nice and neat in order to get an easy A. Not being bored is always a good thing because you feel happier and you are having fun. Going on the computer is fun for most people because you can play games, create pictures, go on @CAPS1, go on @CAPS2, and lots of other things.

The internet is a wonderful recorse. Say our daughter went off to college in the @LOCATION2. How are you going to talk to her? You could write letters but those take to long to go back and forth. So why not video chat or email? That way you can talk to each other everyday and you dont have to sit there waiting around for the next letter. And also with the video chat, you can see what she looks like. Therefore you won't miss her as much. Nature is the most beautiful thing on the planet. There are many different types of nature, rivers, trees, oceans, moutians and animals. With the internet you can map out trails to take in forest or anywere else you want to go. You can book cruses or flight to so many different places all over the world. Who wouldn't love to have a vacation in a little town right outside a rainforest or a six day sail in the @LOCATION1?

9299,1,"Dear @CAPS1 paper, In my opinion computers do have an affect on people. Therefore I think that people spend to much time on the computer. My three reasons are that the constant light going into your eyes is not good for your eyes. Also, sitting there all day on the computer is unhealthy. Last, it takes time away from interacting with your family. My first reason is all the constant light is not good for your eyes. An example to support my reason is that people sit all day long right in front of the computer. While doing that your eyes are absorbing all the light and it burns your eyes. My second reason is that sitting at the computer all day long is unhealthy. An example to support my reason is that you can be out exercising. Instead of out exercising you are just sitting there in front of the computer all day. Another example that supports my reason is going back to my first reason. That it is unhealthy because of all the light going into your eyes. My third reason is that it takes time away from you interacting with your family. An example to support my reason is that you could be out in the beach swimming with your brothers or sisters. Yet, your on facebook talking to your freinds. Another example to support my reason is related to my second reason. That you could be outside jogging with your parents because it is healthy. In my conclusion I am stateing that you should not stay on the computer a lot. You should be on the computer about an hour a day, not even. You should do this because one, the constant light going in your eyes is not good for you. Two, sitting in front of the computer all day long is unhealthy for you.

They allow you to work from home, learn online, and communicate. The @LOCATION1 is full of technology, so we should take advantage of it. First off, computers allow you to work from home. My father is ocasionaly sick, so he cannot go to work. In order to get paid, he logs onto our home computer, and completes his work for the day, instead bieng home sick, resulting in a temporary lapse in pay. Next, computers help you learn online. Dr. @PERSON1 from the @CAPS2 press states, ""Online learning is the foundation of the country."" @NUM1 out of @NUM2 teachers prefer to teach their students online. Some people think that hands on learning is more efficient thant online learning. However, hands on can not teach you what the computer can. Lastly, the computer helps with communication. First, it allows you to talk with friends. Applications like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 are popular for this reason. Also, one can conference with fellow, workers. Email is ideal for this job because it has lightning fast speed to send and recieve documents. Last, computers allow us to give commands to robotic technology. For example, satalites, military drones, and medical tools need computer to function. In conclusion, computers are phenomenal because they allow one to work from home, learn online, and talk to friends. Start using the computer to full advantage!

9301,1,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you really think computers are that bad for our society? Well I don't I think that computers helps our society because you can talk to people from far away places, learn about anything you want, and hold important paper work or personal stuff. Keep on reaidng while I talk about why computers are not bad for our society. First and for most, I think computers are not bad for our society and one of the reason I say this is because you can talk to people from far away places. For example what about if you move from the state that you live in to another and you have no family members write? You know I would like to see them and with a computer you can though out the webcam in i. With out one you need have to spend money on buying plane tickets just to go see them. Like the time my grandmother left to @LOCATION2 and I was in @LOCATION1. She said that she missed seeing me so she got her computer an we saw each other though the computer. Second reason why I say computers are not bad for our society is because on the computer you can learn more thing then if you did'nt have one. One time I had a project in reading on music and how it started and thanks to the computer I was able to find thing out that I didn't know music and pass my project with an A plus. My third and last reason why computers are a good thing for our society is because it hold important paper work and personl things you @MONTH1 not want no one to see. Perhaps you are planing a birthday party for you best friend you can write and hide your ideas so they want see them. Also if you have to write a paper for you boss at work or even your teacher a school you can write of on the computer and send it to them with out it getting lost or stalling. I remember one time I had to write a paper to my teacher so I wrote it with a paper and a pencil and when I was going to look for it I could not find it where I put it and and if I had a computer back then like I @CAPS1 now that would have to write it over again like I did. These are my reasons why computers are not bad thing in our society but a real good and help full thing because it can help us talk to people far away, learn more things, and even hold paper work or important things for us.

People can say whatever they want about who ever they want. Its not right, people can seriously hurt someone. Both mentaly and physicaly. Some @MONTH1 view the human species as the apex preditor, top dog, hunter not huunted. But we are hunted, by are own kind. Online predators pose as someone they are not, they mislead some unsuspecting girl or boy and then make their move. @PERSON2 was on @NUM1 year old girl who loved the internet she would chat with all types of people. One day she met a nice person who claimed to be a @NUM2 year old. @PERSON2 talked with him for hours and hours. On one conversation she told him her team The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 she told him her number was @NUM3 and she had a game next @DATE1. This other ""boy"" researched the team and found @PERSON2's town and state. He made a surprise visit. Turns out this ""boy"" was a @NUM4 year old man.

Although this story seems tragic there are worse things that can happen. When you think of a computer screen do you stop and think ""@CAPS4 makes it run?"" @CAPS5 if you did you wouldn't be staring at it mindlessly for so long. Many people already have trouble seeing so they move the screen closer. The lights that make up a computer screen continuously produce high and low powerlight. When your eye is exposed to light it shrinks or expands to obsurb the right amount of light. With a computer the change is to quick for your eye to follow. It results in @CAPS6 for many. Your physical health is a lot But @CAPS4 about your mental health? Many people use computers and online chatrooms. Sometimes you know these people from school or even work. The internet gives bullies a sense of confidence to say @CAPS4 they want and not have to deal with consiquences. Lets say @PERSON1 resently cheated on a test because he waas stressed about his parents divorse. @CAPS5 one day he loggs on and people from school have found out.

9304,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I heard from my grandmother that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on the computer and less time socializing and enjoying nature. I am writing to you to tell what the absolute definite position on this argument. People are definitely not being affected in a bad way by computers because of three basic reasons. People are not being affected in a bad way by computers is not a place where people waste time. A that people can do on the computer is learn abot faraway places that they have never heard of. A lot of people uses this kind of info. An important scientific aspect to it is that it teaches hand-eye coordination that many people in this world dont have. And perhaps the most important reason is that people can earned with and meet new people from, and can make friends. People everywhere around the world do not know enough about other places around the world, and that is one of the reasons why people are not spending to much time on the computer because they are learning about different places. Therefore because people are learning more about all of these different places, they will want to go visit these places and go on a trip that perhaps they have never been on before. Then when people go and visit, they might like it so much and see that there is a job there just for them, then they might move there entirely. This reasons life would have changed because of computers. A lot of people have very poor hand-eye coordination. Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination. This can then get people to have much better reflexes because of and being on the computer. Since computers teach this very important skill, then people will be able to protect themselves or dodge something because there reflexive skills are so. Because of all these skills that they are learning from the computer people will be much more for life because they will have the ability to do this quickly because they have good hand-eye coordination. Look newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of people in the entire human race have very simple and borig lives because they don't have people to socialize with. With computers people can meet new people and make their lives a better place. When people meet these new people, then they will be able to set outside and have a good time which they wish not set in their daily lives. The most important reson that meeting new people through the computer is that it will establish long-term friendships. Some people live in the middle of nowhere and can't go outside to make friends, so this effect on people is that everyone enjoys. Newspaper editor, some people might say that people to much on the computer. But the other side of the argument is much more aggreable to because many people can't meet new people or learn about other places because they don't love the resources. Computers do not have a bad effect on people, and this is also how a lot of people feel.

Computers have let us land at least @NUM1 missions on the moon. Computers also have allowed us to communicate from that distance. We have also sent rovers to @CAPS2 via computers. They allow us to control them from @LOCATION1. Computers are the reason we figured out what conditions are up in space so that we knew how to built a space shuttle correctly. Satellites have been launched into space to help with transmissions due to computers. Astronomical avionics have been established by computers. Imagine that you go to a far-away foreign country. You arrive at your hotel, take out your webcam, hook-it up to your laptop, login to @ORGANIZATION1 and talk to your family members/friends.

Lastly, you can gain a perspective on the world by reading online news articles. When I was little, @CAPS2 parents were very strict about tv and computer time. They thought that these was no use and they did not teach children anything. One day, @CAPS2 uncle @CAPS3 @CAPS4 came to @CAPS2 house with a present @CAPS5 was a computer game. The land before time and @CAPS5 was for me. @CAPS2 parents did not want to be rude so, they let me play the game. I believe they were actually shocked at how interactive and fun this game was. They were also surprised about how much educational matiriel was in @CAPS5. To me, this is a big reason why I think computors are a good thing. They teach young kids important lessons. Technology has changed so much over the years, and I think @CAPS5 is fun better. This is because you can chat with your friends and be miles away from them. This is a major plus because @CAPS5 helps you build relationships you wouldn't have otherwise. @CAPS5 is alot easier to talk to kids online.

They surf on @CAPS7, chat, antertain themselves by watching videos, funny stuff, breaking @ORGANIZATION1 and even @CAPS10.V.! @CAPS7 is like a super machine. It has everything you can ever imagine!

9309,1,"Dear Newspaper, Are computers taking over? Yes, but in a good way. Computers now are so helpful and are much easier to use then other tools. Computers, these days, have a of positve effects. Computers have replaced some textbook as easy-to-find information, have made keeping in touch much easier, and are even helpful for a teacher trying to teach something to their students. Computer have nothing but positive effects. Computers are a compendium of information. This information is now so much easier to find. It is also much more eficiant to search it on a computer than to drive to a school or library looking for it. Sometimes, people need information right away or have a question they want answers, thats when a computer comes into play. My brother and I always have debates over random topics, like a specific rule for a sport. Instead of us arguing for hours, we ""@CAPS1"" it and our information is right there. Lastly, computers can now help us find our way around. People used to have to ask for directions, step by step, to wherever they want. Computers are complicated, and at times frustrating, but they are extremly useful when it comes to getting information. Information is not the only thing computers are good for they are outstanding at keeping people in touch with each other. Some people think it is a problem we use computers to stay in touch, but computers just made it easier, especially on long distant relationships. I have a number of friends who live far from their cousins family, I do as well. Computers give us the ability to talk to them without having the hastle or needing the money to fly over to see us. When people use computers, they can also make plans to meet at some other time. Wouldn't it be frustrating to have to guess when you were to meet someone? That would be really annoying. Also, sometimes people have the money and time but not ability to fly to see each other. This is when computers give a last resort to see each other. Computers are an outstanding way to communicate. Besides information and communication, computers can be used by teachers to teach a subject. One of my teachers always uses the internet on her computer to show us video clips to give us a better understanding of what a time period was like. These videos really help me, for I am a visual learned. My spanish teacher put together a web site where we can take quizzes and play games. Now we don't have to waste paper on quizzes or have the hastle of brinning home games. Our teachers use the internet and computers to give us the best posible learning environment. People who think computers do not have positve effects should change their opinions now! Computers are extremely helpful in our lives, especially with information, communication, and teaching. Any smart newspaper would definitly write about positive effects computers have emediatly!",,,,2873,34,501,790,14.7352941176,488,1.67,1,219,3,126,103,35,45,19,43,1,0,0,1,1

Personally, I have trouble in school with projects because I never can think of the right facts but computers can help because I can have something to get facts from my grades could improve and with the correct sights my parents and I could check on my grades and keep up with school work.

Also you can learn about other things by just looking them up. And you can do work from your job there. A computer improving hand-eye coordination? Yes it can improve hand-eye coordination very easily. Computers can help improve that by you playing games on them. Kids hand-eye coordination is getting better just because of this. And it can improve adults hand-eye coordination just as well as kids. People learning about other places is great. If you wanted to go on vacation and didn't know where to go. You could look some places up on the computer and choose which one you like the best. And it would also help in school for social studies class to learn about different places you don't already know aobut. Also it would help teachers learn about places too. Being able to work from home would be a great advantage. If peoples kids were sick they could wath thier, kids and do work from home. And if the parents are sick they can work from home.

Also, peole don'@CAPS2 get to go out and enjoy nature as much as they have in the past. Lastly, families have grown apart since the dawn of computers because no one wants to interact with family members or friends. Are you fit? Do you exercise at least @NUM1 minutes every day? You need @NUM1 minutes of activeness every day of the year to be healthy. In my health class my teacher told us that @CAPS1 @PERCENT1 of our country is obeece, this means that they are over weight.

I, know someone who smokes cigerattes because they are so stressed, when all they really have to do is walk outside and enjoy the nature around them. Or, people are just cramined inside all day and barely ever go outside unless necessary. People are drifting apart from each other. Families are fighting, parents are getting divorces, even best friends aren'@CAPS2 alking anymore because they are too busy on the computer. My friend and her mom are constantly fighting because my friend is always in her room on her laptop.

9315,1,"Computers are positively used everyday by millions of people, they help us do business, become edjucated, communicate and even to keep us updated. Having access to computer, if used correctly can deffinately help everybody. Computers and the internet are used for business, weather it be for advertising, a large million dollar online store of simply to make a spreadsheet document. Computers are a main tool in helping industries grow business from place to place by advertising via the internet or emailing a representative. Many people who want an that they cannot get in a local store purchase things in online stores. Businesses weather they're big, small, profit or non profit often organize data in computer documents saving time as well as paper. My colleagues and I, as well as students all over the world often use computers for school or just gaining background knowledge. A lot of the time teachers ask students to type assignments, make powerpoints, create spreadsheets, and so on. Without computers these documents would not come out as neat. This would also be time consuming and waste a lot more resources such as paper and ink. A computer feature called ""e-mail"" is very useful when it comes to getting assignments to a teacher in time. Using you can send documents or messages to anyones computer or email enabled device. Researching on the internet is just as as researching in books, although you don't need to take as much time searching for a book or page. Internet pages can also be updated anytime by the publisher, which is great to have the latest knowledge. Communication is key in being successful at life in general. Computers are to communicate anything in want different forms. As I said earlier e-mail is one @ORGANIZATION1 and most common useful ways of communicating anytime at all as well as instant messaging and webcaming to see and hear the person/people you are communicating with.

9312,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 many people have been arguin over whether or not computers are good. I think computers are a great invention that help many people. With computers people can stay in touch, learn new things and even helps them with research. A major portion of people who have computers chat with others online, via the internet or e-mail. People can send each other messages or pictures in just a few seconds. However, if you wanted to mail these things it could take days and more money. Also, if you lived in another country the prices for mailing to another country can go way up. Luckily, with computers you can chat with people all over the world without having to pay extra. Finally, people can chat quickly over instant messagig and even through webcams. ""Computers are a great way to stay in touch,"" says @PERSON1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 for kids. ""@CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of kids @NUM1 use computers to chat."" I think that is a vast amount of people. My second reason on why I think computers are good, is they help you learn a variety of topics. If you go on the internet you will notice every major company has a website and @CAPS2 @PERCENT2 of privately owned businesses have a website to. Some of these websites can teach you how to cook, build, etc. Then you can also look up events in history and get at least @NUM2 for major events. The internet can give websites that teach you new things you might never learn in a school room because few people knew about it. Finally, they can give step by step instructions for many fun activities to learn. Instead of buying a cookbook you can go on-line and seach for recipes. This brings me to my next reason. My third and final reason on why I think computers are a marvelous thing to have is they help with research computers might cost money at first but the will save you a lot of time and money on the long run. They can type up reports instead of you having to take a pen or pencil and have your arm ache, until it feels like it is about to fall off. Typing makes it much easier especialyy when you are doing research. It is like double tasking. Instead of spending money on cookbooks, encyclopedia, dictionaries etc, you can use you @ORGANIZATION1. You can look up definitions in less than @NUM3 seconds and type it down if you need it for research. That serves a lot of time instead of looking for a writing utensil and paper, then flipping through a @NUM4 pages looking for just one word. If you're looking to do some cooking, type in a recipe that you want to try in the search bar and then in a few seconds there will be thousands of choices. Finally, if you need to write a report on something in history or animal or anything don't go looking through encyclopedias. Get on your @ORGANIZATION1 and look up whatever you need on the internet. In a moment you'll have all the details you need and can start typing away. In conclusion, I think computers are an important think to have. Not just because you can play video games on them, but they keep people in touch, teach new things and help you with research. I think I proved a point to the people who think computers are bad because they kep people from interacting with family and friends aor keeps them from excercising or enjoying nature.

Also I can talk to my friends alot instead of texting away and making my parents phone bill longer than it should ever be.

9317,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am writing to discuss my opinions on computer activity and tolerance. Computers have a negative impact on society. Though they have many positive traits, computers cause people to become distant from their loved ones. Also, internet chats and instant messaging can hurt language and writing. Finally, people spend too much time browsing the web when they could be outside enjoying nature. Computers are bad for modern society. Nothing hurts more than losing someone you love. That does not always mean the death of a loved one. Computers are continuously tugging people away from family and friends. People who are forever online soon become distant from society. Whatching this hurts many people. It is human nature to want attention, and computers are interfering with that. People need to be social with actual people, not machines. Lots of kids and adults use internet chats and messaging. In order to type faster, many words and phrases have been shortend or abbreveated. For example ""laugh out loud"" becomes ""lol"", ""later"" becomes ""@NUM1"", etc. When people get into the habit of typing this way, they begin to actually write and speak in that way. I know that I am guilty of writing ""c u @NUM1"" rather than ""see you later"" in dialouge writing without constant messaging in english language would return form being ""lingo"" to language. Lastly, everyone could spend more time outside. Most of the time that could be taken up by nature is taked up by computers. I would much rather spend time in the fresh air than online. Wouldn't you? In a recent study by the states that a person who substitutes one hour of computer time with outdoor activities gets sick @PERCENT1 less than someone who uses that computer time.

I myself think it is a great idea because children @MONTH1 need a computer for research, to talk to far away relatives, and to get a little break from things that bother them. It is also safe environment for younger children. First, I believe computer usage is a great idea because of schoolwork. I believe that because some students parents might not be of assistance to help their children, nor be able to under stand the homework their child/children bring home. Therefor, using a kid-friendly webpage, such as @ORGANIZATION1, will help the child soak in information. Not only that, help the child get a better understanding. The computer usage would be good for not only at but other things as well. Secondly, computer usage is good for, speaking to faraway family members. Some people move around and loose contact with other family members. If you go on the computer, you can easily unite. Familys can be interactive and can speak to old cousins, or so on so forth. In addition to that, I would like to add speaking to a old/missed family member makes everything forgetful and makes you happy. You can also play games with family members over the internet, which leads me to my next. Sometimes, its okay to have a break off of everything and sit back and relax on the internet. Play a few games, check your facebook here and there, and. Computer time is a time to let go and have fun. I mean want a little bit of computer time? You can't play outside all-day-every-day right? Just chill on the computer, have a few snacks and relax. In conclusion, I can understand why you think that computer usage is a problem, but I gave you my reasons and nows the time for you to decide.

9324,1,"Dear @CAPS1, The ""click-clock"" of the keyboard as you type can be soothing. Whether somebody likes it or not, computers are needed for everyday life. Offices would be chaos without them; hospitals would loose patient info. and airports would be a disaster without them. But what about the average teenager or adult, using it for casual needs? Schools often have classes teaching students techniques on the computer. To complete homework, students have to use online textbooks, type of questions or essays, or use the internet for research for a project. Schools require children to use computers, so when they have that skill, why not use it? Computers teach people hand-eye coordination. Making the mouse without lookingat it and clicking on something on the screen can sometimes be a challenge for some. Typing too, without looking at the keyboard is challenging. with better hand-eye coordination, people have better motor skills for jobs in the near future. Better hand-eye coordination helps students in schools with basic sports in teams, or even in physical education, or @CAPS2.E. or gym. Having advanced hand-eye coordination is a bonus, as well as the skills on the computer. Since you are the @CAPS1 of a newspaper, think of how difficult it would be to paste together your newspaper without a computer or a computer software program that allows you to paste together a newspaper. When typing up articles, you could be hunched over, as some scientists puts it, and not ""be enjoying nature."" A lot of jobs require to use a computer for at least six hours per day. Although some kids have an unhealthy addiction to things on the computer, such as @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. These addictions can be stopped by the action of a parent or a guardian. Children ,even adults, can be addicted to online video g ames such as world of warcraft. But, as i said before, those addictions can be easily taken care of by a parent or guardian. Can you imagine a world without the help of a computer? Without the advanced technology? It can seem pretty difficult, but for a modern society, time needs to be spent on the computer.

9323,1,"Dear The @PERSON1 @CAPS1, I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers tech great hand-eye coordination. @CAPS3 offers people the ability to aquire great knowledge about distant lands and people. Computers also allow people to talk online with other people. Computers seen like one of the greatest things ever created. @CAPS3's just hold to hate something so handy. One amazing skill computers can teach you is han-eye coordination. When I was younger in my second grade class. I saw many of my fellow peers lacking this skills. I didn't understand why because I had great hand-eye coordination. At that line I didn't realize my skill come from me playing on the computer. In third grade we started to take computer lessons. About a month I can many of my classmates just as good as me with them hand-eye coordination. You've can gain this skill from palying a game on the computer to creating a powerpoint. Almost anything done on this wonderful machine will improve your hand-eye coordination. Ever since I have been using a computer my hand-eye coordination has increased. This helps with everday things like cooking to basketball. Computers also offer vast knowledge of distact and people to something that is happening in your town. @CAPS3's like reading a book but on a sreen, @CAPS2 is no turning the page as worrying ahead when your library books due. Computers offer information in words, pictures, and videos. I know without my computer my grades would be down. I use @CAPS3 for my projects and @CAPS3 helps as look for specifics and help me got my A plus. I remember a time when my class was a project about earthquakes. she using a text book. When I arrived I realized I forgot my textbook at I was worried until I I could got the information from the textbook and off of the internet. that was just one information. @CAPS3's knowledge is not just for school work. @CAPS3 has greast information like when is the baskelball game or how to bake a cake. The amount of information you can find on your computer is endless. The last thing that I will be talking about is a computers abilty to let you converse with your friends and family online. @CAPS3's better than a phone where if you have to go do something quickly you leave the phone down and the other person waiting patiatly. That has happened to me on several ocasions. When you talk online you can have a written conversation going with your keyboard. When you type you have time to think. You can always minimize your chat and go the internet if your friend toft. @CAPS2 is also video chat which is great for people that live far away. Its just great to see and hear you friends face who lives across the country. This is such a specbaker advantage over a phone. Overall the computer gives a positive effect on people. @CAPS3 teachs you great hand-eye coordination. Computers offer a vast amount of knowledge and allow people to talk online. So I would be pleased if you, The @PERSON1 @CAPS1, wolud post my opinion of how computers effect people positivly. If you post this I thank you.",,,,3074,43,547,808,12.7209302326,531,0.89,1,241,0,159,102,34,23,13,70,1,0,0,0,0

Computers help children and adults learn about different cultures around the world. They can also help hand eye coordination in all people who have a computer but most of all computers provide fun and entertainment. Computers are a necessitie in everyday life dont base them because a few lazy kids wont listen to their parents. Computers are good and good for us. When my parents were young they always said they wanted to see newplaces and travel around the world. But they just didnt have the money. Poor poor parents but now because of computers children, teenagers adults can learn about places @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 without stepping out of the door @CAPS4. New Places states ""when children or adults for that matter dont learn about other cultures they are more suseptible to fear of different people and things, there could under develop their brains and because of their and stupid brains it could start another @CAPS5."" With computers it lets wealthy middle class and even tower class enjoy the learning abilites and cultural nesecisties that they need abount. New things are god and computers help us a get there. Another reason why computers are great is because they help teach hand eye coordination.

One effect is that kids are dateing people online that they donÕt know so when the go meat the person its some old person. ThatÕs a rapest and then they will get raped and a lot of times even killed. Thats reason one. The seond effect is that the kids that stay on the computers all day because arnt out side exercising there eating junk food. So after a long period of time they will up to get or get sick very badly. Thats the second reason. The last reason is that they arnt doing anything fun like outside playing sports hangout with there friends and will end up to lose all of there friends becase they will never be able to hangout.

9326,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you believe that computers are unsafe and inappropriate? @CAPS2 you think they are waist of time? Don't you believe that on computers you can see the world and everything in it? What if you needed to get directions to somewhere quickly what would you @CAPS2? I dont think computers are a waist of time. I say that because everyone, from a millionarie to a high school senior who wants to apply for a college, use computers. A millionarie could use it to keep their money and other important thing intact. A high school senior would have to use it to apply for college and to @CAPS2 homework. I believe that you can see the world and everything in it on computers without having to leave your house. One reason I believe that is people can take pictures and post them on their webpages and blogs where you and many others can view them, before or without going anywhere. For example, on websites like @LOCATION1 you can find a hotel room and price on it if you need to go away but don't have a place to stay. Another example would be @CAPS3.com if you need a airplane ticket or need to now what time your flight leaves. Lastly if you need the quickest direction to somewhere computer are usually accurate. Say your cousin @PERSON1 and his wife and their kids were coming to stay with you in @LOCATION3 from @LOCATION2 and @ORGANIZATION2 is driving. What happens if they need direction, before they leave, on how to get to your house and back to @LOCATION2 and they dont have a map? They can use a computer or cell phone and go to @ORGANIZATION1 and get what they need for directions off of their and be on their way. I dont think computers are a waist of time.

9327,1,"How would you like it @CAPS4 you could talk to people online when your not with them? What about @CAPS4 you could research about places that you might want to go to? @CAPS4 these answers are @CAPS1 then computers will be great for you. Not only can you talk online with people you can research places and you can even play video games on the computer. Many people like to be with there friends and to be able to hang out with them. When your not with them dont you wish you could talk to them somehow? Computers give you this availability and it makes many people happy. For example say one of your best friends lives in virginia and you only get to see him in the @DATE1 wouldn't you want to talk to him? Computers allow you to talk to people wherever they are and give you the connection to people you dont see a lot. Talking online is a outstanding invention and is one reason why you need computers. Dad ""can we go to @LOCATION1?"" @CAPS2 @LOCATION1? Without computers you have @CAPS5 idea where places and what you can do there. With computers you can research about any places and it will give you great information. One time we were choosing between @LOCATION1 and @CAPS3. This is were the waterslides helpes out family a lot. Once we saw the waterslides, waterfalls and all these amazing features about @CAPS3. We new we had to go there. So what @CAPS4 you didnt have a computer? How would you be able to know about the place? You wouldnt thats what computers are great for deciding great vacations. @PERCENT1 of kids and young teenagers love to play video games. the computers offers a huge variety of games that kids would love to play. Some adults might think playing video games on the computer will decrease your grades in school and your mind in general. I think that video games help people. They increase you hand eye coordination, your reflexes and many more. This would help you @CAPS4 you play sports too so not only is it a great amazing things to do on the computer but it helps you in sports. Computers are a huge part of my life and many others to. How would you feel @CAPS4 could talk to your friends? How would you like to go to a place that is awful because you dont know what its like? How would you feel @CAPS4 you couldn't play video games when more then half of love to pay them?

Computers aree very beneficial for paying bills, chatting, and for a research. Computers are always there when you need them. Computers are beneficial because they help pay bills. Some people have such a busy life that they often forget to pay their bills! Since they get on the computer, then they will remember because of a @CAPS1 thing called sticky notes inside of the computer. They work just like regular sticky notes, but the only difference is that you can't take them out of the computer screen! Therefore you won't forget it! Some people use computers to pay their light, gas, or water bills. For example a few days ago my aunt paint her light bill and it only tool her two minutes! usually if you go to pay it at the store it is usually full of people so you have to wait thirty minutes just to pay one bill. Also, you can pay your phone bills online, too! Yesterday my mother took out her laptop, sat on the couch and paid her phone bill in just thirty seconds! I thought it would take longer because it takes ten minutes at the @ORGANIZATION2 store. Computers are beneficial because you are able to chat with your family from another state or country! Usually, I would be on @ORGANIZATION4 video chatting with my cousin for long hours just talking about our lives more and more I though my momuses oovoo, anothe chatting website, because it's more fin when you begin to type in a message to that person. Computers are beneficial because you are able to do some research. I remember when in writing class we had to do some research on google about @ORGANIZATION1. It was so much fun because we all got in the tech lab, and we were able to go on anyhting we'd like to on the computer to find out information. After that everyone had a lot of knowledge about @ORGANIZATION1. The adults can also use it for printing out information for if they hav to do a project. I remember watching my sister print out a picture of a plant cell and human cell for a project was so great and organized that she got an A++ on it.

9330,1,"Dear Newspaper, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 say that they have at least one computer on at all times. Although computers can help people with work, they do not benefit the society overall. People are on computers constantly instead of exercising and staying healthy. Also, the internet can be dangerous, especially for kinds and the more people are in the computer, the less time they spend with friends and family. As I am sure you will agree, computers do not benefit the society. Computer has become a problem across @LOCATION1. Being healthy has been a huge problem for the @CAPS2.S.A and computers do not help these problems. Many @CAPS1 do not exercise which is very bad for health. They don't exercise because they are on computers. Staring at a computer screen is provenly bad for eyes, especially at someone is staring at the screen for a long time. Enjoying the outdoors and spending time outside is very rare for those with computers. They would rather stay inside on the computer than go outside. As another example, there can be people trying to hurt others in some way through internet and email use. Online bullying is becoming a serious problem, further supporting now computers hurt society. Online bullying occurs on the internet. Also taking and giving away personal information including where you live, is a mistake many people, especially kids, make. Spreading a virus or bug to someone else computer is not impossible but it is very harmful. You could email a virus to someone else, harming their computer and anything they might be doing on the computer. As you can see, harming people through computers is no joke. There is supposed to be nothing more important than family and friends however, computers have lead to people, especially teenagers, ignoring friends and family for their computer life. Ignoring your family can lead to a bad relationship with some of the most important people in your life. It is not easy to mend damaged family relationship. Also, treating your friends badly and being mean can lead to no longer having friends because you ignored them in the first place. @CAPS1 have become so caught up in their computer life that we have become more interested in an online life than a real life. In conclusion, because of lack of exercise and enjoyment of nature, as well as people online and being a bad family member or friend, computers hurt the society more than help it.

9338,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 in technology are happening everyday. I believe this is not a good thing. People who use computers regularly aren't outside getting fresh air, they don't exercise much, and don't see family or friends face-to-face very much. Computers are limiting the amount of time spent outside. My friend @CAPS3 spent so much time on the computer, he became addicted! The boy who used to spend hours outside now locked himself in his room just to go on @CAPS4 and game sites. But @CAPS3 isn't the only computer fiend. @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 students say they would rather be inside on the computer, rather than be outside. Child psychologist @PERSON2 says that being outdoors increases the amount of time spent with family at night. Family's watch @CAPS6 together. Don't you want more viewers? Computers also decrease the amount of excercise in society. My ex-boyfriend @PERSON4, who was once the @ORGANIZATION1's best athlete, can barely run a lap around the track. For his @NUM1 bithday, his mom got him a @ORGANIZATION3. For the next @NUM2 months, @PERSON4 stopped playing football, lacrosse, and running and spent most of his time with a baG of fritos and his computer. @PERSON4 has gained @NUM3 pounds since his birthday present arrived. @PERSON4 isn't the only one though. @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people who recieve their own computers decrease their excercise by @PERCENT2. Dr. @PERSON1 says that if people continue to spend more time on a computer than excercising, obesity rates in @LOCATION1 will rocket. Do you want to be known as ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8""? Lastly, with all the computer technology, people are spending less time talking face-to-face. My friends ex-boyfriend @PERSON3 downloaded ooVoo on his computer. ooVoo is a web video-chat application. After downloading it, @PERSON3 stopped hanging out with his friends and just video-chatted with them. Instead of visiting his family in @CAPS9, he would just ooVoo with them. Galligan isn't the only ooVoo maniac. @PERCENT3 of ooVoo users decrease time with family and friends, but increase computer time. Dr. @ORGANIZATION2 says that decreases in face-to-face encounterS with people makes working in groups or with colleagues much more difficult. Do you want work as who can't communicate well? All in all it is obvious that computers are bad physically and mentally. They increase time inside and away from family and friends, and decrease exercise.",,,,2416,31,399,627,12.8709677419,378,0.89,1,207,2,146,73,21,33,15,64,2,0,0,1,1

For a short period of time computers is fun and entertaining way to pass time in the long run they severly impact peoples likes negatively. The usage of computers completely destroys people lifes. Using computers is dangerous and causes many people to get addicted to them. If you really think about it, do computers really have that many benefits? Children and teens have been killed due to using their computer often! Some experts says computers allow people to chat with other people online but talking to strangers online potentially has life threatening consequences. It @MONTH1 seem cool to talk to people in ""chat rooms"" but children have been abducted and killed because of some one they met in one of these chats. For example, there was a girl named @PERSON1 who would spend all day talking to this random man on her computer. She decided to meet up with this man who was pretending to be a @NUM1-yr old looking for a girlfriend, But he was really a @NUM2-yr old sex offender. @PERSON1 met the man at the mall and he then abducted her. Luckily she got away, but because she went on the computer she almost got killed. Also, people have gotten info from the computer on how to take their own life. How would you feel if a friend or family member was killed because of the computer? The real problem with computers is that people become addicted. Instead of playing outside or exercising people are staring at a computer screen all day. One of the main reasons that over @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS1 are obese is because they spend too much time on a computer. These people do not do any exercise because they are on the computer and therefore obese. For example, my cousin would spend all day on his comp and now he was @NUM3 lbs. Also, all the activities on the computer distract children and adults from the homework and work. Children have bright futures, but many are throwing it away by using a computer. Do you really want to throw away your life by using a comp. too often? Computers can be beneficial but the negatives outweigh the positives. Computers are dangerous and causes people to become addicted and ruin their lifes.

There many advantages that computers give you but I think the dangers and negitive effects computers have on most people overcome the advantages. Spending too much time on your computer can change the way your mind @NUM1 body . Not only that, you can lose prechious time with your famiy and friends. All children, teens and adults need to think about the dangers in technology today. Every week you might hear a new story about people meeting strangers online and think to nicely of them. People are harmed or abducted all the time now a days because of putting the wrong kind of information online. It's easier than you think to get tricked by stranges that look for people to hurt just because of being on computers too much for the wrong reasons. There are also computer bulleys that can ruin someones life by threatning and bulleying them. So the best way to avoid these horrible people is to limit your time, or don't use computers for socializing at all. People all over the world are becoming addicted to video games, websites, chatrooms and computers in general. A study showed that over @NUM2 people in hamden spend over @NUM3 hours on the computer a day. There are so many parks and feilds that children/teen can go excercise and play at put most people would rather spend their time sitting at a computer being lazy! Every person should have @NUM4 hours of excercuse a week to be healthy but not even half of the population reaches that due to computers. I love spending as much quality time with my friends and family because no one can predict what will happen in life, you will never know what could happen the next second. Sharing time with your loved ones is very important, you can even go to a park or go for a walk in the fresh air. Every minute counts, so would you rather spend them with your family and friends or at home sitting on a computer? I can understand if you're intrested in a faraway places or people, or if you just like learning about new things but insted of ""frying your brain"" you searching them on a computer, you should go do a library!

9341,1,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think that computers have a positive effect on people everywhere. They help us to communicate with people all around the world. Computers also help us learn, research, and study for school and work. Lastly, computers are necessary in our society. They help everyone a lot and make our lives easier and more convenient. As I said before, computers help us to communicate. Not only can people talk with friends using @CAPS4 @CAPS5, but computers give people the ability to talk with relatives and friends that live thousands of miles away. For example, families that live in the @LOCATION1 now have the ability to e-mail and even video chat with their relatives that live in @LOCATION2. Talking with someone overseas on a telephone costs a lot of money, so computers help people save that money. Computers are probably used the most for research. Every person who attends school has to research for reporst projects, and homework. Computers make researching all the more easier. For instance, when a class has to write a paper on a historic figure, they can research on the computer all about this historic figure. Computers also make sereaching more convenient. It is much easier for a student to research from home than to go to a library and search for books. Lastly, computers are used everyday in our society. To, they are necessary, @CAPS6 use them every day to sotre important papers and files use computers in order to keep track of ad to organic. Schools use them to hold imformation and to other students to research you can see, they are used every day by almost everyone. In the example it shows, they are almost necessary not having computers could produce a big problem. For example, in hospitals, computers hold valuable information that could help save someone's life. Not using computers daily would require everyone to change their life style. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on not only people, but also our world. From children to adults, people use them everyday. People use them for various reasons too. From talking to relatives overseas, and storing files that have an important effect on someones life, computers are used everyday by almost everyone.

Another is that computers help you type faster so when the time comes you will be typing so fast people cant see yor fingers they will be moving fast too fast. Also if you want to know about computers that would be great! You could know where tons of things are in them and you could teach them to other students.

You could learn new places you haven't even heard of and find out @CAPS2's the place you want to live. Also, you could research your favorite place in the world.

Also chatting is another great way for communication. You could video chat and set what they are doing right this second and see how they look.

9350,1,"Dear Readers, The question that everyone is pondering, is does the advances in technology benifit the society, by using computers. I certimtly do not think that computers benefits the society. For one, those people are not out exercising becoming healthy and fit. Also those, who sit around looking at a screen are not enjoying the nature, nor are they spending time with their family. Everything comes and goes, and the people who choose to use a computer all day miss out on all @CAPS3 it, they truely do. When peole sit around not moving anything but their eyes and fingers, that shows that something is not quit right. Instead they should be out exercising. I went to @CAPS2 doctor, @PERSON1, and I questioned him how many people were overweight. he replied, ""@CAPS1 average @CAPS3 seventy five percent @CAPS2 patients are overweight. ""This just goes to show what is happning to our world. if they don't go to the gym, they can walk around their neighborhood, go for a hike, bring your child to playground, and play and have fun with them. There are many ways people exercising while having a blast. It all comes down to or not you put your mind to it. While people sit inside, they are everything that is going outside. They are missing out nature. Nature is a @CAPS3 thing, and get out while it is still I remain I and I had a blast. I didn't have a computer, t.v., or anything technological, but you know what I didn't even need any @CAPS3 them. i also went hiking throgh the woods, it was beautiful, all @CAPS3 the trees and plants and the little stream runing along side @CAPS3 us. if there's a beautiful day out, go to the park have a picnic do something useful with the day. Parents always say that, ""@CAPS2 babies have grown up so fast."" @CAPS3 course you don't want your children to grow up, but you have to make the most out @CAPS3 their childhood, and sitting looking at a screen is not it. You need to spend time with your family while you still have it, because I can guarentee you, you will regret it if you don't. There is always a will and a way, to find time for your family, no matter where or when. In summary I do not think that advances in technology in computers benifits society. people who do agree, that think computers benifit society, are waisting their life away and not getting enough exercise, they are not enjoying nature, or spending time with their family. We need to make a change and fast because once we do this world will be a better place.",,,,2481,26,458,632,17.6153846154,446,2.84,1,203,1,111,106,14,34,23,40,1,0,0,0,0
9352,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION3, Computers have a negative effect on people. They are used way too often. Also, using the computer can be unsafe. Lastly, using the computer is unhealthy and not fun. I will tell you why computers do not have positive effects on people, and I know you will agree with me. First of all, computers are over used. According to the @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of teenagers who use computers are on @CAPS1 for @NUM1 hours a day! That is insane! How could someone use the computer for that long? Using a computer too often makes you feel tired and lazy. Scientists at @ORGANIZATION1 have proved that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 teenagers in @LOCATION1, or over use the computer, over using the computer can take away your education, one time, I was supposed to write an essay for school but I didn't get to finish @CAPS1 because I was on the computer instead of writing the essay, over-using computers does not have any positive effect on people. Computers can be extremely unsafe if they are misused. There are so many people on the internet who try to do bad things to either you or your computer. For example, if you were talking to someone online that you didn't know, and they said they were a @NUM4 year old girl, how do you know they are telling the truth? This person could be a @NUM5 year old! for all you know! Also, people can send you viruses or hack your computer access to all of your documents, files, pictures, and many other personal things that on your computer. ""@CAPS1 is very hard to prevent a hacker from hacking your computer"", says @PERSON1 from @PERSON1's computer software. absolulley having people look through your computer has a negative effect on people. In conclusion, computers are unsafe and can lead to bad outcome. Lastly, using computers is not fun and unhealthy, when you are on the computer, you are sitting in a chair and looking at a screen. This is so unhealthy and boring! wouldn't you rather be playing outside with friends and getting active? Imagine, that you are at the, a nice sunny day and you are swimming in the refreshing, cool water. This is so much better than sitting at home and using the computer. Instead of playing sports on the computer, you could go outside and play them for real with your neighboors. Not only would getting active be more fun and exciting than using the computer, but @CAPS1 would be more healthy. using the computer is not exercise, but playing outside is! using the computer has a negative effect on people's bodies and is not fun. Computers do not have a positive effect on people. Computers are used way too often. Also, using the computer can be unsafe. Lastly, computers are unhealthy and not fun. Using computers have all negative effects on people, and I hope you realized this from reading this.

Some of these reasons are that they make searching for information extremely easy, allow people to communicate across long distances, and even provide carious methods of entertainment. First of all, computers make searching for information extremely easy. Before the internet, one would have had to drive to a library, search through the tens of bookshelves, find a book relating to whatever the person wants to know about, walk to the librarian, show him/her the book, have him/her check out the book get back into the car, drive home, open the book, comb through the vast amount of pages, and then the right information might not even the there. Now, one can just search something on @ORGANIZATION1 and get thousands and something millions, of results in under a second. Anyone would agree that this is a much more efficient system. As well as using it for research purposes, studies show that about @PERCENT1 of people get their mews off the internet, and about @PERCENT2 of that @PERCENT1 get their news from social networking sites such as @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 @CAPS5. This is because of how easy they are to use, and because they don't require even leaving one's own house.

I just into the community not forget that the business will from my purches. That is how benifit from computers. If you think of our modern world today everyone is talking about the cool things you can do and do with. You can talk to each other without using phone. Years ago took several. Some at the newest computers come with a camera two people can look other on talk in real time even if there miles and miles away. Companies been made on computer games. Most people try to the time.

Didyou now that @PERCENT1 of people have atleast one computer in their home. Also for school lets say that your in collage and you have to write a paper on the history of music instead of looking hours for books about your topic you look it up on the net. Another reason computers are awesome is you can look up something to see if it's true you just go on the computer to see if it's true instead of going to the library and tooking through thousands of book and tie isn't these so you wasted time looking for a book that wasn't there.

9361,1,"Dear @CAPS1, Technology has advanced over the years and one of the biggest advances is computers. My opinion about comuters is that they are quick, most of the time very accurate and can be fun sometimes. Computers make our lives esier to watch movies, do work homework downloading and recording music, and many others activities. Many artist record music with the help of computers for example @CAPS2 and @CAPS3-@CAPS4. These two musicians have been very sucessfull in life. With the help of a computer they do touch ups and sound effects on their voice so that their album or song sound extremely good. Where would these two big stars be if computers didn't exist? They would maby be homeless or living in an apartment instead of a mansion. How different their lives would be.

Computers are also expensive & dangerous if you use them the wrong way. Computers also lead many kids getting suspensed. Websites like myspace or @CAPS2 are additing. It is very hard to stay off them for more than @NUM1 hours. People who are on the computer constantly are what we call computer addicts.

When people are on the computer all day they get no excercise. They also miss out on all @MONEY1 the good things you can see outside @MONEY1 cyberspace. If they just get off @MONEY1 the computer for a day, the addicts might realize that there's more to life than just the internet. Let's go back to myspace & @CAPS2.

The issue states by many groups are that it is surpassing exersize in way of time. This @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be true but if it is certainly no reason to try and limit computer time for the @CAPS3 people. The way myself and others have come to see this issue doesn'@CAPS7 agree with the ideas listed above instead I believe computers benefit society. There are many ways computers and handheld computers benefit people these being the skills such as typing and hand eye coordination people learn fron using computers. Also computers provide a huge job industry, and at the same time supply useful info. Due to growing oppositiom people have forgotten what computers do for you. First off everybody who owns a computer or iPhone knows they are useful pieces of technology. For example say your heading out the door and need directions you would probably hop on the computer and print a ma instead of being lost in traffic for an hour. Computers also help students find information for school and extra curricular. i know my computer has helped me! Also for groups who dont support computers and believe it replaces exercise I believe to help them advertise the benefits of exercise they should start internet ad campaigns to traget peopel like you and I. By doing this and using the riches of the internet they can please both computer and hardcore fitness types. A second reason to support computer use is for its physical and proffessional benefits. The physical benefit computers have are the hand eye coordiantion it teaches through typing this can improve a persons reflects quite. In addition typing is a skill many jobs require in all fields and typing tests are becoming standard. So in turn if you use a computer often than you are learning a valuable skill that just might learn you a paycheck. There are also many new job openings in computer realted industries such as video game and design teams for major companies such as @ORGANIZATION2. My final reason for supporting advances in the computer world is that the more advanced computers become the easier life gets. i know this because I have worked with every computer system to their newest @CAPS4 @NUM1 and I have worked with all @ORGANIZATION2 sysytems from @CAPS5 @NUM2 to the new snow @ORGANIZATION1. And the newest sysytems @CAPS4 @NUM1, and @ORGANIZATION1 have made everyday tasks easier such as taping @CAPS7.V. watching movies on the go and much, much, more. I believe within five years computers @MONTH1 even be able tasks could help anyone, so why wouldn'@CAPS7 you want this wonderful industry to flourish? In conclusion I believe this industry should have support from everyone. It should grow and simplify life. Some computer advances like the iPod even get people into exercising by running.

If you dont go outside, enough you can get sick easier. Going outside is always good for anybody. We can learn play or just have fun in the sun.

After school I usually hangout with @CAPS2 family or friends. I went over @CAPS2 friends house and when we got there she didn't even say hello to her mother, father, brother or even her dog! Instead she took @CAPS2 hand and brought me into her room, closed the door and showed me videos on @CAPS1, the whole time I was there. Lot's of @CAPS2 friends grades have been going down because they haven't been doing their homework or studying for their tests, @CAPS2 friend is an average A student but shet got addicted to the computer and now her tests grades are @CAPS3-'s and they are still sinking. Now that we are at an age of responsibility our parents usually give us chores to do. One day I went over to @CAPS2 friends house and her mom told her to clean her room. I was okay with helping her clean her room but she had a huge problem with it and tried all kinds of excuses to get out of it. Finally her mom gave up and we kept playing games on the computer. Finally, I believe that people have been spending way too much time on the computers because of the examples above.",,,,1656,14,311,420,22.2142857143,308,4.79,1,152,1,78,72,9,26,19,38,0,0,0,0,1
9367,1,"I understand that lately people have had many different opinions on computers. People are wondering if they are helping us or hurting us. Personally I think that computers are hurting us. My first reason why I think computers are hurting us is because every single day when somebody signs on to a computer they spend two, three, maybe even four hours doing nothing. Computers are way too time consuming. There are so many new websites filled with so much information that people spend hours looking up pointless things and finding people you havent seen since highscholl. It is so wastefull. People have other respondsilbilites to do. When your on the computer you loose track of time and before you know it, it will be bed time. And you hav'nt done homework, or washed the dishes. My aunt told me this one time she then she forget make dinner for her family. My second reason why I think computer are hurting us is that there are so many websites out with dangerous people. You @MONTH1 be on a website where your talking to some twenty-three year old male but in real life he could be a @CAPS1 @CAPS2. That's the thing you can never tell who you are really talking to. It is very dangerous and scary for children. If you and you put your a stranger might call and rob your house. In my on a website which she thought but someone got a hold of and posted it on more and more websites. She was so embaressed. My third reason why I think computers are hurting us is that if your on th computer the whole day you probably arent going outside and getting fresh air and exercise. When your sitting at your desk on the computer your not moving. You probably are eating cause your bored which isnt good. Instead you could go out side go for a walk with a friend, go for a bike ride. Kick around a soccer ball. My friend always goes straight home to the computer and strats munching on a hunger potato chips gained five pounds in a week. You @MONTH1 still think that computers are helping us because they provide us with the information quick but if you think about it some of that information isnt true and these days there are so many you cant get the information you heard. So if you want my opinion on how computers are people. My opinion is that computers are hurting us and they are time consuming, dangerous and make you lazy.",,,,2325,27,430,604,15.9259259259,418,2.06,0,206,0,101,93,28,24,19,46,0,0,0,0,0

Which you've heard over and over. You're on the computer so much you start to lose your friends and gain some weight. Computer's I think are putting a bad effect on people of this centry. I mean if you think a bout it we spend to much time on computer doing either work or pointless gaming. Also this is a big problem, computer softy, with all of those websit's like facebook and my space, you never rly know who your talking or sharing information with. Lastly children and adults become ""addictive"" to what ever they do and don't want to be involved with friends and family. If we keep all of this up we @MONTH1 have a big problem on our hands. If you're a parent, @CAPS2 many time's have you said, ""@CAPS3 get of that computer and get your work done!"" or ""@PERSON1, get off the phone an clean your room!"" @CAPS4 are things that kids hear every day. In fact we hear them so much we hatrully will respond, ""@CAPS5 mom"" or ""yeah, okay"" when we really don't intened of getting off @PERCENT1 of kids don't listen to their parents when it comes to technology devices. They take away from kids lives. They take away from adults too. We ask our parents to play ball or to help us with homework but no!

The message was aslong me all @CAPS4 personally question's about were I like and if I was home alone. I replyed back saying this was none of there business. This person wouldn't leave me alone they told me that they were fourteen and lived in avon. I told my mother and she called the police. they solved the problem. The point of that was I was really scared and this man wouldn't leave me alone. Just think you never know, who you are really talking too.

Now people are getting ill because they dont exerce because they waste their time in the computer. Now my opinion is that computers are bad for you. Well like I said they don't spend time with family or friends. Well I have a friend that loves computers and he is allways on the computer.

On the computer you can meet other kids. They will help you for a job that you might have in the future, and you can learn about far away places from it. Computers keeps @CAPS1 social nad can teach of many things. One reason why the computers effects the people is it lets us communicate with other people. On the computer you can email your friends and instant message with friends. This helps tell your friends what you want to say without having to call them. If your long distance from a friend it is way faster to to email them than it is for them to send a letter that you would have to wait five days for. Many people also have pen pals. To stay in touch, the easiset way would be on the computer. You would also be to lend picture or each other on the computer so you can see who you actually talking without a computer interacting with other people would be a lot more difficult. Another effect that computers have on people is they can help people practice if obey to work with one for a job. Almost it every buisness there is a job that requires somebody using a computer. Without using it an earlier are we would have no knowledge or how to work it. Many of the jobs that have a computer invoked it a lot of parctic usint it. It would be impossible for somebody to do these jobs good without having the practice of it as an earlier are.

If there was no internet thge kd would time to spend a lot of time thinking of what kind of material you need to use but with the web you have everything you just need to get started and work on it.

Computers have given us more advanced technology, the internet, and communication. Continue to read this letter and I'll explain further. First of all computers have given us more advanced technology. Computers are used to create better programs like word and power point. If you have ever used these programs (which I am sure you have) you will agree. Also, the video games kids play, they are created by computer. I'm sure every kid loves computers for this. Lastly, computers have led to the creation of laptops and @CAPS3's. These are very juse . If this hasn't made you agree with me yet, my, last two reasons will convince you. My second reason is, people can use the internet. If the internet doesn't benefit anybody, nothing will. You cannot get on the internet with out a computer (ye ipods and phones are computers). People need to do research for projects, work and school. I know I need to and I'm sure you do too. Another reason that the internet is good is, you can find out what happend in the world without @CAPS4. People always turn on the @CAPS4 to find out the weather. Next thing you know, they are watching a @CAPS4 show. With the internet you can look at the screen, see the weather then turn the computer off. If I haven't conv inced you yet this last idea will. My final reason is you can communicate. You can talk with friends with out the phone. my last tthing is, I know communication can be bad but it also teaches lessons.

My reasons are computers teach you hand-eye coordination, acess to informa tion, and socializing. From a computer a person can learn hand-eye coordination. Which brings up my first reason a computer is a great effect it teaches hand-eye coordination. For example with a computer it teaches you typing skills, increases your speed and helps memorize the keys. Another example is a computer gives you a machine just your needs. This is one reason why I believe a computer has a postive on society. This brings me to my next reason, which is it gives acess to all information. For example if you are unsure of something look it up and I know you will find a answer. This is increasing your knowledge you can recieve so much knowledge from a computer. Another example is a computer will update you will just everything. It can update news, events, weather, and much more. This is another reason why I believe a computer is a positive effect. Now this the to my last reason, why a computer is a positive effect on a community. With computer you can not only do the things I where you can have to friends. You can search the web and socialize at the same time, that is pretty amazing. You can stay in contact with someone across the world. Another example is by talking with your friends this is learning. You would be learning now and your would grow. So this is why I strongly believe that great for the community. So these are my reasons why I believe my opinion that computers have a positive effect. They teach hand-eye coordination, and have socialize with friends. What could be wrong about learning and talking to your friends. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Just think about it if we have this technology we could not have all this information we have now. So in my honest opinion I believe computers have a positive effect.

With advancements in technology everyday, our society grows and learns even more without computers, I find that I would be lost. Luckily thogh, I was a @NUM1's kid and blessed with technology. As people's lives begin to grow more and more hetic, there's less time for people to do what they really want. I know this is the situation in my life; I'll wake up early in the @TIME1, scuttle to school for seven hours, and stay after for two more hours I come home from school at @TIME2, and suddenly, it's bedtime for me. Like many other people, I like to watch @CAPS2, but with my hetic schedule and lack of a our, I can't watch shows that i've been dying to see all week, like @ORGANIZATION1 or lost. With websites like @LOCATION5 though, I can shows that provide entertainment for me. @LOCATION5, streams episodes of @CAPS2 shows on it's website, allowing for millions of people to watch it, who wouldn't be able to otherwise. Also, as another source of entertainment, people have played games on the computer for a while now. The provide a fun way to pass the time and you can be happy, while you do. A very popular game currently to @LOCATION1, on @CAPS4. Many of my classmates play this game, and I can hear them chattering about it, in the halls, with more computer advancements, more ways of entertainment @DATE1 up everyday. Whenever I have a research project do, I jump straight to the computer. Why? Because I know it's a never ending source for information, unlike @NUM2 years ago, research is now much simpler to do, I'm currently doing a research on the oppression of women by the cultures that they wear. By using the computer, I've gathered usually information about tightlacing cassets and binding in the song dynasty. The computer allows for a faster, more convient way to expand your knowledge on any subject. If you need directions to a place, you can @ORGANIZATION2 it. Or, if you need to know the capital of @LOCATION2, you can @ORGANIZATION4 it. The computer also allows an faster way to access news. Within minutes, I can find out about the latest breaking news. I remember going onto @ORGANIZATION5's website to find headlines about a typhoon making windfall in @LOCATION3, where my best friend was for the @DATE2. But with my computer, I was able to find out it had not struck any damage in @LOCATION4, where she was. For me, the computer is a wonderful source of information. With my sister in the @CAPS5 currently it's hard to get a hold of and see how she's doing, I worry about her, being alone in a different country, with no one to code after her. But with the program @CAPS6 I can easily video chat with her erasing all my questions of her well being. @CAPS4 is also a popular social networking site, which allows people to reconnect with old friends. My aunt uses it to find her old high school and college friends that she misses. Also, with websites like match.com and @ORGANIZATION3, adults can find people, that have mutual interests as they do. With advancing technology, the computer continues to be a link between people. In my opinion, there's no better invention that the computer. It allows us to achieve things, we never thought possible.

9379,1,"Dear local Newspaper, I have heard the recent debate about positive and negative affects computers have an people. Well let me tell you I believe computers have a possitive affect on people for many reasons but some of them are, they help people comunicate from @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION3 or @CAPS1. Also they help out the enviorment in a couple of ways. Lastly a lot of education is now based on the computer. In the following paragraphs I will be explaining why computers have a positive affect on people. The first reason I beleive computers are good for is comunication. For me I' live in @ORGANIZATION2 but my family lives in @LOCATION2. When I go on sites such as facebook I am able to talk with my cousins, aunts, uncles and it is fun. Also since @LOCATION1 is considered the melting pot this benefits many of us. Another reason comunication is key is for world trade. Many companys use the internet to comunicate with there customers which brings me to my next point, that being enviorment. The internet helps our enviorment by letting people buy online. This helps familys save gas which is expensive and that also helps global warming. All the talk these days is on how to help with global warming and needing more fuel efficent cars. By people shopping at home they have no need to go out and that doesnt let burning fossil fuels iinto our enviorment. Another thing is it can save many trees. If teachers put the homework on the internet instead of on paper trees are being saved. Even you newspaper companys can have people read it on the internet and save so much trees. My last point is education being based on the computer. Education has changed in our time. It used to be all by hand and reading books, but now it is computers doing the hard work for us. There is no need to write out a paper anymore because it can be typed an @ORGANIZATION1. An example I have of this is in my science class we do labs and lab reports. My teacher does not want us to write it out she wants it typed. Also some colleges even let you take your classes online. Everytime I watch t.v. there r a comercial for it. And as a student we never wanna read to these are sites that only give us the important info about the book. This is why I believe that the internet has only improved society. The reasons I believe this is well it helps people all around the world comunicate with each other. It helps out our enviormental needs as a world. Lastly it has improved our education segnifigantly in the past @NUM1 years.

I end up falling asleep around @NUM1 am. That is the beginning of the next day! I'm not alone in this @PERCENT3 of kids are up talking with their friends until @NUM2'clock or even later. Dr Even @CAPS1 state that teenagers need as much sleep as they can possibly get starting from @NUM3 to @NUM4 hours of sleep. @NUM5 hours of sleep isn't even enough sleep for an adult. If we are more rested then there is more enery to last us through the day. We can be more cheery and patient and make the world a better place. Something I have notice the past @NUM6 years are that my social skills have been decreasing. I am finding it easier to talk to my friends online than talking to them face to face. On my computer I don't have to respond as quickly so I have more time to think of something funny or inteligent. If our generation can't learn how to look people in the eye, then how are we going to get jobs in our future? Eye to eye conversations are more meaning full and respectful to others. This is why familys have dinners together so you can talk eye to eye. Computers are extremely unhealthy for our nation. We will become overweight by sitting around and not being active, become cranky by lack of sleep, and will lose the respect in talking face to face because of online chatting. So now, editors of the @ORGANIZATION1, help our generation and make the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 a better and healthier country.",,,,2752,33,501,741,15.1818181818,490,2.06,0,224,0,125,113,39,47,15,53,2,0,0,1,1

There's a better way to talk to them instead @LOCATION1 using minutes on your phone. You can talk to them or type them by aim or a webcam. It's a cool way to talk to them like if your mom sick you can talk to her and see from your computer isn't that sick well i think it is. It also helps if on a bissness trip on a holday you can still see her and your child on your computer in no time. That one way to us your computer. Now my second reason for the computer is the news. It helps you see about the economy if it's in bad shape or in a god shape. I also you see the forecast if it's going to rain, show, are a terrible coming your way. There are a lot site to see the news in your own country to see how is and the websites all so have a chose @LOCATION1 language like spanish french or problebly even jappanesse.

I say thgis because some people can get addicted to the computer and when this happens its probably very hard to get that person away for a while, @CAPS2 reason is when a person is on a computer constantly it could most likely kill many braincells. I say this because after a certain amount of time a few other things could happen as well such as looking at the screen all day long @NUM1 days a week. This @MONTH1 cause you to become blind. Actually I have a few connections to make about this cause I am a computer freak! for example I have a laptop and @CAPS3 on it like on the from the I come home from @CAPS3 at I also know somebody who has to wear glasses from the effect on computers.So anyway even though computers can do more in people they can actually help you out with a lot of stuff.

9384,1,"Dear @CAPS1 inquire, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that peoples opinion on computer vary. In the past we have not had some access to the web until now. @PERCENT2 of kids at @ORGANIZATION1 who took this pon posted by student council agree that computers are good. I support the cause that computers have a good effect on people. First of all, computers are a good way to learn. The internet has facts about everything, so you will never out of thins to learn about. You don't have to wait for a teacher to help you on a subject either. They don't because your computer can answer all of your questions. And the computers nowadays are very fast, you wait have to wait at all. @PERSON1 softwear enginner says, I used to hate having to waitin school to be called by a teacher. That is why I use my computer when I have a question because @CAPS2 answers @CAPS2 imediately. That is how computers are a good way for you to learn. Secondly, computers have good applications to help with your schoolwork, one exmaple would be a built in calculation. The calculation makes my life so much easier. Especially when I have to do homework. I remember this one time where I forgot my calculator at home and couldn't do my homework because the problems were too hard, I though I was helpless, but my computer really helped me. Another useful item that help my schoolwork is being able to check my assignments online. @CAPS2 is a good way to stay caught up if you are sick and away from school. Those were some useful applications to help with school work. Lastly, computers help keep in touch with friends. If you havent seen your buddy in a while, then the internet will help you get to seem them once more. The internet is also an excellent way to make plans to visit a friend you havent seen in a while. Beside that, you can also use a camera to meet face to face with a friend. @CAPS2 will be like you are actually with each other. all while not even leaving your house. @PERCENT1 of people who took the survey I created say that the camer is perfect for convenience. That is how you can keep in touch with afriend. In conclusion, you should agree that ocmputers ahve a good effect on people. They do because computers help you learn, they have applications for school work, and they help you stay in touch with friends. Now you should support my ideas thet I wrote to you. The choice is all up to you.",,,,2392,31,446,615,14.3870967742,433,1.67,1,199,1,107,98,18,26,5,57,0,0,0,0,0
9387,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that computers have a big effect on people. Computers prevent people from going outside, they become lazy, and spend less time with their family and friends. No worries though, I am here to explain the reasons more to you. So you have a better understanding on computers effecting people. First, computers prevent people from going outside. I would think that people might actually want to get frsh air, but I guess not. By them having fresh air @CAPS1 makes their brains think better. Also computers make them not able to play with friends. Instead they play games and activities online. All people should see their friends in person, not just talk to them on the internet. Second, computers make people lazy. When they become lazy they don't exercise or which causes their body to become unhealthy. In fact, @CAPS2 country doesn't really need or can afford for people being unhealthy because we are known as the most obeast state. As I said about people being lazy cause people not to eat right, well @CAPS1's true. People who are on their computers mostly just eat junk food. For example, they might be on a game or talking to a friend, and they want something to eat so they run to the kitchen and get a bag of chips because @CAPS1's quick and easy to get. When instead they could get something real to eat. Most importantly, computers make people spend less time ith family and friends. They are on computers all day that @CAPS1 comes down to some not even talking or seeing their mothers, fathers, and even siblings. Now honestly thats pretty sad to hear. People arent going to be able to bond with friends and family when their upstairs or wherever the computer is. All their be able to do is bond with them online which really isn't the same as in real life. So once again computers have big effects on people because they prevent people from going outside, make people lazy, and makes them spend less time with family and friends. Hopefully I explained the reasons well enough so that you will say something about @CAPS1 in the Newspaper. Thanks for listening.",,,,2123,25,379,536,15.16,374,2.06,1,171,0,94,75,32,37,17,39,2,0,0,0,0
9388,1,"Dear @CAPS1 of newspapers, I have a strong opinion on why computers are bad for you. @CAPS6 are so many reasons why they are so bad. Almost every @CAPS2 has one. So we are taking about over @NUM1 million computers! And all those people using them are at risk for the following. Its clear that a lot of people use computers. There are all kinds of @CAPS3 like @CAPS4, @CAPS5, mySpace, and many, many others. So how long do we go on for? @NUM2 hours, @NUM3 hours, @NUM4 hours? Well all that time on there can damage your eyes. For example, me! Yes me, @CAPS6 last coupple of years ive been adicted to them. Once I on for @NUM5 hours! Well guess what I'm wearing now, glasses! My eyes are horrible. I actully need them when I am ready to drive! So I narrowed my time down to @NUM6 min a day. So be careful how long your on! Hey! Dont forget about your good old exercise! I hate to break it to you, but most @CAPS7 suffer from obesselity. So many @CAPS7 over weight. Just because of lack of exercise. And the computer is preventing you from exercising. So if you yet off that computer, go for a walk, maybe a bike ride. The things you can do to exercise goes on and on. To be honest, when I narrated my time from the computer, within a week I felt way better. And that comes with happy and positive emotion too! Another thing is, no nothing phycical but saftey! When you talk to someone online. Sure it can be your friend, but theres bad people out there that can find out your username and find personal information about you. So say you stay on far @NUM2 hours. You have a better chance being revild personaly to strangers then someone stays on it for @NUM8 to @NUM6 min. So reduce yes time to be safe also! So, there you have it. This is my opinion. Please follow it. I have a last hand experience with it. I promise if you narrow your time to @NUM6 min you will feel more energized, and happy.

9386,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are very convent pieces of technology but they can be considered a niesence. I recently heard that computers are frowned upon by many people. I strongly agree with this statement I feel this way because computers can cause people to not get up and exercise. Also computers cause you to not talk to someone ""face to face"". Finally, computers have many adviertisments that cause you to invest money. I want you to consider about putting my article into the newspaper so your readers can know how I feel . America has the highest obesity rate in the world. About @NUM1 of @CAPS1 @MONEY1 overweight or obese. That's @MONEY1 out of every three people! I believe that computers are part of this problem. @CAPS3 you are on the computer, you can do anything on the millions of websites the computer, you can do anything on the millions of websites the computer has to offer. You can playgames talk to friends and upload pictures. You can spend hours each day on the computer because you lose track of time. I remember @CAPS3 someting similiar happened to me. I went on the computer and began talking to my friends. Before I know, I had been on the computer for six hours! Instead of going out and exercising. I was on the computer. Thus, computers cause poeple not to exercise. There too busy playing games or updating their status @CAPS2. Another health problem with computers is lack of son. Your body needs sunlight in order to gain . If you stay inside, you will not absorb the sunlight and you will not gain some vitamins and minerals. A local doctor said, ""People who stay inisde on the computer all day, wont get sunlight, This can lead to skin cancer."" @CAPS3 you are talking to friends online; you are not talking to them face to face, you are typing to them. COmputers are bad because they can develop social problems. this someone always ""talks"" to people online vis A.I.M. They would never talk to someone face to face. This can effect someone becuase @CAPS3 they go for a job interview they will have troubles talking the person . That is not the only problem of ""talking"" only. @CAPS3 you are typing to someone, you always your works so it is easier to ypt. SOme example of the are ""lot"", ""ike"", ""k"". This abrevetions can affect your grammer because you are so use to typing those that is why computers cause you to lose face to face time with other people. Did you know that everyday, there are more than @NUM2 viruse?! That is staggering number. This is another baout cokm,puters. @CAPS3 you are surfing thw web at least once, you will get a pop-up that says that you are the @MONEY1 @MONEY1 vistor and claim your prze. These are very dangerous because these @MONEY1 all scams. If you where to click on the pop-up, @MONEY1 of two things will happen. You would either get a virus of they would age for youe credit card number. no matter what you would have a consiquence. A similar situation happened to me.

My mother had to bring it to best to get it fixed and it costed @MONEY2. We were lucky that they didn't ask for a credit card number because they steal my mom's credit card and use it. This is card identy that and the average person who gets their identy stolen, has to pay @MONEY3 to someone. The computer isn't s safe place.

9391,1,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 it has come to my attention that a group of people are concerned than people are spending to much using computers.

The internet and computers can be a great educational tool for students and teachers. In conclusion, the internet is not a bad thing and people should not stop using the internet.

When using the computer for long periods of time, it can become a risk factor for the personÕs health. It increases the amount of family interaction time of the user.

If a person is so used to always being on the computer, they @MONTH1 not interact with others. They could become caught up on what their doing on the computer and not worry about whatÕs going on around them. One thing that can really effects a user is email and chat.

For example, a study shows that more then @PERCENT1 of teens rather go on the compute than ride a bike.

And most of them aren't involved in any sports."" This also shows the impact a computer could have on teen in a negative way.

It has been brought to my attention that you will be writing an article on whatever computers have more positive or negative effects on the public. I firmly believe that computers are wonderful pieces of technology. i believe computers benefit society because they help people of all ages communicate electronically, and they provide @CAPS4 a source of entertainment for everyone @CAPS4 well. Yes, some experts @MONTH1 feel that computers harm society, but I can assure you that these electronics never cease to help us. One strong reason to prove my pant is that everyone has a chance to communicate, whenever they want. Several websites that have been invented on the internet allow people to talk to their local friends and family, and even people overseas! For example, a site known @CAPS4 facebook connects people from all over the world. You have the ability to start conversations with acquaintances over the internet through it @MONTH1 not seem like it, this site is not just for teenagers and people of this age great. Facebook also connects older users to elementary school friends, college buddies, or even colleagues at work. @CAPS4 a matter of fact friends by facebook, and can they can talk to each other all the time sites similar to this include @CAPS5, twitter, and myspace. Also, ther are many ,business sites @CAPS4 well. For example, say you cannot apparent reason several websites can transport you to the mee ting @CAPS4 long @CAPS4 you have a simple hook-up video camera. Can you imagine being at an international comittee meeting directly from your couch? Thacks to computers, another form of communication is now possible. Another point on why computers positivily influence our nation is that it provides many brilliant sources of entertainment for all ages. Do you think your child could possibly be tired after a long day of academics and physical activities. If so, computer games are a great way to brighten his or her spirits. There are a variety of @CAPS6 games on the market, and these will make your child jump for joy. There are many fun and useful things on computer for adults @CAPS4 well. There are online newspaper all over the internet nowadays, which even this very own @CAPS1 @CAPS2 has. Online newspapers are more convenient for adults because you can adjust the font ifbthe reavder has poor eyesight, you can just scroll down instead of flipping through pages, and there is a full database of articles from the launch of the online newspaper to now. Although, this @MONTH1 not seem necessary. You can watch television on your very own computer screen. Whether you missed your favorite @CAPS7 show or a certain sports game isnt telecasted, computers always have live . Furthermore, computers also provide @CAPS4 an outstanding source of entertainment.

9397,1,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 people have their opinions on computers. Some people happen to like them, while others hate them. I personally don't like them. They reduce exercise time, when people are surfing the web, they spend less time with their friends and family, and they are very distracting. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are obese. They drive to @ORGANIZATION1, grab a fatty burger, and drive home to eat it on the couch, while on the internet. @CAPS2 @CAPS6 watch tv or go on the computer instead of exercising. Studies have shown the amount of over weight @CAPS2 has increased over @PERCENT1. If we don't show this information to anyone, they won't be able to understand @CAPS8 computers are affecting the way we are. When people go on computers, they get obsessed. They'll say, ""@CAPS4 hold on let me just check my email and then we will go to the gym."" @CAPS5 the truth is, They are going to hooked and stay surfing the web instead of exercise. This might not seem like it, but too much time on the computer and not enough in the gym could turn you into an elephant, or even kill you! So save yourself and go exercise! The more you are on the computer the less time you are with your family and friends. Just @DATE1, my aunt came over to say hi and my brother was on the computer. He didn't even notice she stopped by. I know computers are good for chatting with friends and family that live far away, but honestly, they can't always be online. Next time your friends and family are over, try to stay away from the computer. I am sure you have researched something on google or you know someone who has. The internet is very helpful. It's like a first aid kit for your knowledge. If you have ever researched something, you should know it so much easier than looking in a book, but when a teenager or child does their homework infront of the computer, they get distracted. @DATE1 night my friend was lookijng up iunformation for her social studies essay and she got distracted on facebook. She told me today that because she got distracted; her researched wasn't done until @NUM1 A.m. This will be the future of generations to come. The time has come to rethink about going on the computer. The next time you want to log on, think, ""@CAPS6 I rather log on, or go out somewhere with my friends?"" @CAPS7, the next time you realize you are on ask yourself, ""@CAPS8 long has it been since I exercised?"" @CAPS9 we can get people to spend less time on the computer and more time with friends!",,,,2476,29,459,628,15.8275862069,454,2.06,1,212,1,115,98,25,32,21,56,0,0,1,1,1
9399,1,"To whom it @MONTH1 @CAPS1, I know there is a big debate over if the computers are good or bad on people. My effects of opinion, is that computers have a positive effects on people. They are stress relievers for people, they can connect people, and they can teach us about being healthy and safe. First of all computers can relieve stress in a person's life and/or put them in a better mood. I know, when I'm having a bad day, maybe @NUM1 minutes on a computer makes me happier and more calm. Computers games and things like that give us a chance to calm down and just enjoy ourselves even for just a bit. Second, computers bring people closer through websites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 but also ways like email and instant messaging. People might argue that computer-users spend too much time on these websites, but they also might talk to a friend that they havent talked to for years and decide to go out for lunch or things like that I know there are at least @NUM2 people that I hadn't talked to for years because of distance that I to reconnect with through the use of @CAPS2. Computers are a great thing so we are to old and distant family members. My final reason why I think computers have a positive effect people is because of all of the things we can learn on the internet. If you have ever seen a home page to awebsite like for example, @ORGANIZATION1, the homepage has a lot news stories and articles. So, people might say we can just crack open a book if we want to learn. However, people won't randomly open a book just to know one thing. These home pages have articles that catch our eye or get us interested. So we read them and we learn things, sometimes we don't even know we are learning them. Believing stress, keeping us connected with others, and teaching us things are all positive things that the computer does. Therefore, they have a positive effect on people and I hope you can agree.",,,,1908,17,358,496,21.0588235294,354,4.4,0,175,0,90,66,25,22,18,44,1,0,0,0,0

Not having computers is people have less time exercising. For example, having less time exercising can lead to less stamina. Research shows sitting in front of a computer makes people less healthey.

9410,1,"Humans will spend on average of one million hours on the computer this year. The computer is a very technologically advanced piece of equipment, and more people will begin to use it each year. When you spend too much time on the computer, it can become an addiction. People @MONTH1 find themselves on the computer @NUM1 hours a day. Secondly, the computer is a distraction, and kids @MONTH1 not get their homework finished. Lastly, the computer and the internet can be dangerous and display inappropriate content. People can access things on computers about you all the time. If you do not want any of this to happen to you, then keep reading my passage. Fifteen percent of people will develop a computer addiction this year. I think that the computer is actually a disadvantage to @LOCATION1 because it takes away our time to just relax. Since life is so short, we need to stop and smell the roses more often and the computer is preventing @LOCATION1 from this. Another effect the computer can have on @LOCATION1 has to do with our health. When we sit on the computer we're not moving around, @CAPS1 our health will start to decline. Lastly, people @MONTH1 start to realize themselves becoming different people. And soon no longer just have fun, but will spend their only free time on the computer. Computer addicition is one reason why computers are not to our advantage. Imagine a school boy playing his favorite computer game, while his backpack full of homework sits in his room. Before he knows it, it is his bedtime, and he never did his home work. Time spent in the computer is time lost for homework I believe that if kids spend more time on the computer, their homework wont get done. Because of this, their grades will slip. Children will not be anble to play sports with their low grades either. Lastly, kids wont be able to pay attention in class because they are too busy thinking about their computer games. This is another reason why time on computers should be limited. Lastly, I think computers are bad for society because they are dangerous. There are countless social networking sights, and people can talk to anyone on ther. This is bad because you coud be talking to someone you dont know on them. Computers can also trick you into buying pointless things you dont want, or cheat you out of your credit or social security card number, which can lead to horrible after effects. Finally, there is a lot of inappropriet content on the web that anyone can access. Children, teens and young adults shouldn't have to see anything the dont want on the web. This is my final reason why computers are not an advantage TO @LOCATION1. So in conclusion, Local Newspaper, computers are not a good thing. I believe everyone should limit their use of the computer to prevent addiction. Reduced time on the web also leaves more time for homework. Lastly, the inappropriate content is the final reason why computers are not as great as they seem. If you want to stop all of these reasons, then don't use the computer.",,,,3022,35,534,794,15.2571428571,526,2.06,0,232,0,158,96,30,34,14,58,0,0,0,0,0

Lastly keeping in touch with all of your is important. Knowing how they feel about the job, what are hapening, or just getting ti know them. What easier way is those to stay in touch with works than e-mail. I understand that computers in schools can lead to bad website and behavior but, it has more of positive affect on than bad.

They give you the ability to learn about news on other countrys, they let you with friends from all over the world. Also that you can go to online instead of having to drive to school. The computers are for exactly where anything important is happenings. For ex. @CAPS2 if you have a friend from, @LOCATION1 and he/she was in a burning building of is in count for. You check on the news but the news reporter dont tell about this accident. You could use the computer for that type of problems. Computers could help you find a job in desprate. Much faster than checking on the newspaper. Another great ability that the computer has is a with at. Chat with friends in different states. The people have plenty of to go outdoors. At least you will know that your friends and family is being. The best part is that you can go to collage online unstead of driving @CAPS2 if you got you were playing to go to collage to a good but you cant because you have children to take @CAPS3't you be greatfull for the experts that invented the computer to give the previlage of going to collage online.

I don't think you do now listen up as I give you reasons why. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are @CAPS2, now to me that sounds like a problem. A trained eye docter @PERSON1 says that every @NUM1 hours you spend on the computer you gain up to about @NUM2 pounds while your sitting. So think about it. If you are on the computer for extended periods of time that is bad. For every @NUM3 hours you are gaining nearly @NUM4 pounds off of just sitting looking at a screen. So to all those computer hoggers out there, @CAPS3 off your lazy behind and enjoy life and life free and unstock to that weight gaining monster you call a computer. Another horrible thing computers can do to you is cause you to go color blind. At the pathways to technology school @NUM5 out of @NUM6 students went color blind after just a week and a half of being in front of a computer screen @NUM3/7.

I mean it's ok to go on every once in a while but to be consistantlley on is just terrible. Becoming color blind can affect several things on your life. and not to be funny but you won't be able to have a favorite color anymore because the color you will think it is would not be the actual color. Perhaps you might think an orange is a lemon or a apple is a pear. I stopped using the computer so often hoping that this wouldn't happen to me.

I belive computers have a positive impact of people. Computers provide hand-eye coordination ability to to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. computers have a very positive influence on people. Compuers provide people with hand-eye coordination. Their are many types of programs that help you learn how to use the keys on a computer. A common game ""typing @CAPS4"", helps many children learn how to use the keyboard properly. I am an exelent typer because of all the programs/games on the computer. Next, when you type you learn to keep youre eyes on the screen. This helps you with hand eye coordination been use your typing without looking to see were your fingers are on the keyboard. Last, hand-eye coordination helps you to be better at other activities. for example if you are a in soccer. You kneed to see were the ball is and catch it with your hands. Computers make more aware. Computers give people the ability to learn about away people. Many times in school you are assigned to a project, that you kneed to find information about. Insted using book the internet gives you fast easy wat to find all the information you need. Secon you could learn all about a person, culture on computers. For example say you wanted to learn a @CAPS5. You could find out now much they belived in greck goods. Also, yoou cold learn what they love to eat and what they wear.

First of all, internet can be very addicting, people will spend in hour at a time on the computers everyday. They never see their family. In the end the family will grow apart and they wont be close anymore. It is a fact that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people lose interest in family members because of the internet. Family members will have new things came up, for example, little anna get  on by a school bullyer got into @CAPS2, the addicted person would never have known that because his eyes were glund to the computers screen and his mind was  in cyber land. Since no one is bonding with one and her anymore, people will start yelling and fighting with other family members because they forgot what it was like and been they got along. Is that really what we want, families breaking down and battling one another? Family members should be bonding and getting allong, especially financial times. Next @CAPS1 is no exercise towards their body and their becoming  unhealthy and soon their amoum system will start weakening and they will soon become sick quite often. People are too busy playing their latest found online game to where they forget about many things and eat junk food because they are too lazy to make/cook something healthy for themselves very soon they are going to become very unhealthy. Dr. @DR1, a very important and known doctor states that most unhealthy diets and bodies are caused by junk eaters who are occupying all of their time on the computer and not getting any exercise. Last, people are never getting any fresh air that is very important in a healthy lifestyle, think about what you are doing to your body. To conclude their are very unsafe things on the internet that people never think could have happened to them, their are sex offenders who pretend to be a  of the opposite sex to the one they are after and try to luer them in. Haley, a beautiful @NUM3 year old girl was tricked into meeting an @NUM4 year old, man who assaulted her and killed her and she always thought ""that won't ever happen to me.

In @LOCATION1, there is a problem with obeasity. Many teens, children, and adults are obeast. Instead of them at the computer, they should be out side for a walk and exercising.

Including exercising and being fit. Going outside for a walk and take in all of the beauty of nature with the long times people are on the computer it is even time that could be spent with your friends or family. Exercise is probably one of the most important things in life to maintain a healthy life style. When people are spending all of these time on computers they have no time to be able to go out and exercise. One of america's big controversy is obesity. People are always complaining on how we have the largest obeise population and we need to fix it. But truly what is there to suspect? Dont we put these problems on ourself?

Three ways computers have a good effect on people are we can communicate with others using computers, we can learn about events happening in the world right now and we can also learn more about the world, I believe that computers are good and have a positive effect. The first reason why computers are good is they help us communicate with others. These are a lot of websites on computers that allow us to communicate with other people. You can also chat with people who live far away to get a better understanding of people's beliefs and way of life. I think because of computers there is more interaction with other people. You chat with people you don't normally talk to at school and you can become better friends with them. So many kids are on computers, so you definately don't interact less with someone. No matte how far away they are you can talk to someone. My second reason why computers are good is you can learn about events happening in the world. Most children, or nine out of ten children do not watch the news. The computer helps me find out about events happening now. These are many websites that have events that happened in the world and around you. @NUM1 out @NUM2 kids I surveyed said that leading the news online was better than watching it. The internet lets us know how our favorite sports team did us how the stock market is doing today. Through the internet, I found about a lot of events going on throughout the world. My last reason on how computers have a positive effect on us is we can lear more about the world. Many kids probably only know facts about where they live, or what people around them eat, but with the internet we can learn about a country half way across the world, not just around us. I know have a better understanding of what people in @LOCATION1 eat or what religion they follow because of computers. If you were going on a vacation to a far away country, wouldn't you like to know that the weather is like, or what type of money they use. I know I would. Computers have taught me more about the world, and ways to protect the world. Even though computers are good they can also have a negative effect. Kids do spend a lot of time on computers, but some of my friends and I can only use it for an hour a day and our parents make us exercise after we use it. We also play a lot of games, but a lot of games are good for you and keep you thinking and exercise your mind. Not all games are bad, some help you learn new things and words.

They also have the ability to teach us more things then @CAPS1. Most people are starting to become lazy and not exercize, enjoy nature and interacting with family and friends. Computer's have a positive affect on us because they get people to use computers. Instead of using type writers. Most people don't understand how to use a computer so they have trainers that help them understand it. Most people want to learn how to use a computer well so they have special programs that will help you understand how to use a computer. A computer has taught us how to do hands eye coordination. We learn how to interact with friends by using email, chat, and facebook. It let's us communicate with family by using webcam to communicate. It helps us understand most things too. We also have the ability to speak with others. For example we can communicate with people from @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1. That's why we have hand-eye coordination. We also have the ability to learn more things a computer then a encyclopedia. A computer can tell us things from the past that we haven't known before. We can learn about far away places like the culture of @LOCATION3 or things from @LOCATION2. We would also be able to type a paper on word. Now instead of hand writing, if we have the ability to type it. It correct's your errors for you. How cool is that! Instead of being lazy now you can go outside and interact with friends.

Who would want to go outside on a rainy day. I certainly wouldn't on a rainy day you can web chat with friends or make crazy videos. That's why I prefer a rainy day then a sunny day. As you can see computers are very useful in the world. They have a positive effect on them. They can teach us all about hands eye coordination. We have the ability to learn more and interacting with friends. If computers weren't around then it would be very weird not having them around.

They also allow free chat with total strangers. It even keeps you from going outside for some exersise. Computer's are bad for the eyes. Sitting in front of a computer all day isn't healthy at all. Your eyes can become watery, bloodshot, or @CAPS1! In my own experience with computers my sight has gotten @CAPS1 since sitting in front of them all day. Computers can majorly effect your and can cause you to have to get glasses. Who wants to have annoying glasses anyway? Glasses can get dirty, break, and are just a bother to wear. Another problem with computers is its access. Computers allow you to freely go on any site you want. For example, let's say you signed up for a free chatroom. How do you @CAPS2 who you're really talking to? A young boy or girl you meet on the internet can be the opposite and @NUM1 years old! Even if you seen there pictures, you don't @CAPS2 how they got those. These could be pictures of anyone. Another safety hazard is cyber bullying! A cyber bully is someone who insults others and makes than feel unwanted or hated. Just like any other bully. This kind of talk has lead to many child suicides in the past and now. So, watch what you say or do online. It's a fact that, using the computer all day keeps you from physical exersice and activities. Such as a beautiful day for a bike ride. Except all your doing is sitting at your computer in the dark of your unlit room. It's good to get exersice to stay in shape. Even if its a hot day out then go swimming, thats a form of exersice. A hot day deserves a in the pool. Most definatly net playing a computer game. If your friends are out playing baseball or soccer, join them! Get off the computer stay healthy! Of course, even in the winter you can get exserice or have fun. No need for it to have to be @DATE1 or @DATE2. Snowball fights, snownen, sledding, all great winter activities. So, have a blast get off the computer! Go outside! In conclusion, computers are a addictive device that's unhealthy. Now that I've explained some reasons of the effects of computers: the health of your eyes, the unsafe access, and having exersice and going outside.

Any information you put on the internet about yourself can be seen by anyone around the world. Sometimes a person can send you a spam email which is basically a virus that can infect your @CAPS3. There's also popups and phony ads which business's trick you into entering contests like ""win a free cursor"" or ""win a brand new laptop"". One of the mose dangerous things about computers is cyber bullying. A lot of kids on social networking sites like @CAPS1 or myspace abuse these sites purposes. These sites purposes are supposed to be used for talking to family and freinds far away. Instead kids are using them to to say mean things to people because since they're not talking face to face they think it's okay. Well it's not. In fact sometimes kids go to far and spread rumors about a person on the internet, which usually causes them to kill themselves. Another @CAPS3 issue is online stalking. Online stalking is mostly on social networking sites but it's still a serious probelm. The sweet innocent looking kid your child talks too is usually a @NUM1 year old @CAPS2. Online anyone could post a fake picture of themselves and then lie about their age. Then they trick kids into meeting them some place alone. Once your kid meets them face to face them well you know what happens to them. Finally, another serious issue is spyware. Spyware is a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 where it sees anything you do on the @CAPS3. It sees your email, online purchases, favorites sites, etc. The scariest thing about spyware is you never know you have it. Also the only way to know it you have it is when your @CAPS3 breaks down.

Also, people should have other responsibilities to worry about desides reading their emails. Last, the computer is bad becasue when you meet people you don't knoe, it gets a little frightning.

Next, @CAPS1 people I know like to be in shape when meeting their friends and family that they haven't seen in awhile. I am seeing this because if that person wants to look good or healthy then maybe they should step away from the keyboard and exercise. Also, if people don't exercise enough then their body just gets weaker and they never do become healthy and fit. This is why people should exercise instead of being on the computer. Next, people should have other reponsibilities to worry about, besides reading their e-mails. Also what if you have a dog and don't have the time to spend time with it. If you stop going on the computer then you can have fun with mans best friend, and maybe even go to the park. Last but not least, @CAPS2 bad because when you meet people you don't know, it gets a little frightning. Next, if there is a young child maybe in the preteen years that has for example a @CAPS3/@CAPS4 or @CAPS5 and @CAPS1 people you don't know tries to add you as a friend. However, if this young child thinks that they might know their parents so they add them. So, now the computer can be dangerous because there can be people watching you.

Let me tell you some more on why I agree to this. First, they teach hand-eye coordination. For example, when your typing and you haven't reconized the key's you go on a website that can teach all about hand-eye coordination and you'll learn how to type and memerize the key's. Second, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. For example, say you would like to go on a faraway trip or learn about someone from @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I or @CAPS4 you'll have to go on the computer and search up the information for it. Third, even allow people to talk online with other people. For example, if you have a family member who lives faraway from you and you want to stay in contact and you have no type of phone you will need the internet to go online and chat with them from there to keep everything updated. Fourth, you can play many games that you like. For example, say you like shooting games, dress up, and fighting but you can't afford you can go on the internet and play in free and there you could play any kind of game that spots your very own eye! In conclusion, I agree because I think computer's are real good for our society because they teach hand-eye coorination give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people.

Finally, all of the things that you might have had trouble finding before is now simple when using a computer. First of all, computors have become a huge part of school systems. Schools nationwide have computor labs and there are always classes going on in there. Students can go to these computors and do research for projects or other assignments. Also, as you get into middle school and high school there is a lot of reports and projects. You will have to turn in a final copy which must be typed. Without the use of computors it will make these things hard to do. Also, a lot of schools are now useing programs on the computor to help educate the youth. Programs like are great study tools and you can also take quizzes and tests on it to see where you are at. Furthermore, on a different program you can make graphs for math or science. Over the past few years, computers have been a big part in schools. In addition, the new advancements in technology has made it very simple to go online and talk to your friends. You can send emails through computors to friends everywhere. It's a lot easier and faster then sending a letter through the mail. You can also use one of many instant messages on the computor, as long as you and your friend are both on the computor you can talk to them as long as you want for free. Another great way to express yourself and communicate with friends is to use facebook. Facebook is good because you can everybody whats on mind as well chatting privatley or so everyone can see your conversation.

As I have observed more, andmore people, I'm starting to believe computers @MONTH1 be taking over the lives of many people, @CAPS1 teenagers. Their lives are all over the internet through programs like facebook, or twitter. Many people are starting to branch away from their families. As a nationwide concern, staying healthy and fit ; computers don't help with that problem. Besides, think of all the fantastic nature you're missing out on everytime you press the on button on your computer. Furthermore, please believe that computers are keeping us from our lives. Firstly, family and friends are the fuel to a good life, emotionally. The more time you spend on the computer, the more you isolate yourself from them. Consider if your parent, be it mom or dad, spent all their free time on the computer, how would you feel? Like they didn't want to spend time with you, or even be enjoying their free time without you. Well if you are a teenager who stays in their room and spends endless hours on the computer, that's how they're going to feel, so turn off that computer, and spend some time with your family! Friends are important too, so go take a walk outside once in a while and just talk! Secondly, the more time you spend on the computer, the less time you have to go exercise and be healthy! @PERCENT1 of teenage girls spend more than an hour on the computer a day, which takes awaay from the many aspects of being a healthy girl on a sports team. Many more people should be concerned with their health than what the latest gossip around school is. The sun only shines for so long in a day, and you should rather go outside and enjoy it, rather than waste it on the computer. Thirdly, the most beautiful thing in the world is natural beauty, like nature. The computer tends to occupy the nation and we don't even get the chance to see the beauty all around us. ""I love being outside; its free and open,"" says @PERSON1, a local flower shop owner. ""@CAPS2 these days, they really don't know what they're missing."" I totally agree with @PERSON1 on that one! On the other hand, some @MONTH1 argue that computers teach hand-eye coordination. I just go outside and play a sport. It honestly teaches it too, and you'll benefit more from going outside then staying on the computer.

The modern day computer has kept us from taking the road less and by this I mean, society has been given a world in which we take for granted and don't appreciate. Computers are the mainfactor as to why this is happening. Citizens spend all day at home, sitting on that chair that spins around, staring at the computer screen, and trust me, i'm guilty as charged. But I've come to realize that theres nothing better on the computer screen than the facebook home page. These devices are taking our lives away, and keeping us from loving the life we have. Some people realize this now, and soon mother nature will too, and she'll react to it. Polls have been taken that show the more time spent sitting in front of the computer screen leads to less interaction with others. This popular advancement today is not only astracting us from others but leaving us an interdependent society. The more time we spend at home, the lee time we spend with the ones who mean most to us. We are losing friends and family to adevice that does nothing for us. How much longer will it be until the the average interaction with mankind is completely vanished and out of our lives for good? As you can see, computers have their negative aspects as well. These devices affect our health not only physically but mentally, keep us from appreciating what we have, and leave us interdependent in the long run.

9442,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, an abundance of people use computers on an everyday basis. Each day more and more people are getting connected to this very beneficial device. Computers definately have a positive affect towards humans. They allow people to meet new friends, they give people the ability to learn about all different cultures and topics. and they teach people vital hand-eye coordination. Who doesn't love and look forward to the moment you get home and turn the on your computer? Computers are essential for todays modern world. Firstly, computers allow people to meet new friends. Think of all the relationship building websites. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION4, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and many more. President of @CAPS4. @CAPS5, states, ""I think almost anyone who creates an account with @CAPS4, will instantly have a handful of new friends."" This shows comupeters make enormous social lives for people. When I signed up with @CAPS3, not only did I find my old friends, but I also met many new people who, thus, I have become very close with. A statistic shows @NUM1 people who sign up with @ORGANIZATION4 find a mate they end up marrying. Therefore, computers allow for everyone to make new friends and form close bonds. Secondly, computers give people the ability to learn about all different cultures and topics. @PERSON3, principal of @ORGANIZATION3, explains, ""@CAPS7 classrooms are almost always typing away on computers, whether researching about sea stars for biology or learning a complex language."" This shows computers are vital to a student's @CAPS8. A recent study shows students learn @PERCENT1 more accurately on computers, than through a textbook. Without computers, all local schools would collapse students would be like chinos stampeding through the saranghetti. I've fluently learned @PERSON1 by @ORGANIZATION2, an online laguage learner. Hence, computers are very effective and give people the ability to learn about all different cultures and topics. Lastly, computers teach people vital hand-eye coordination. @PERSON2, pediatrician at @LOCATION1 hospital, states, ""Computers serve as a positive way to teach hand-eye coordination, which, is extremely needed in a growing child or tren."" @CAPS8 @CAPS9 composed a poll about who plays sports compared to who uses the computer. Amazingly, @PERCENT2 of the atheletes went on computer daily. Hand-eye coordination is absolutely necessary during sports. Who wants someone on their team woh can't throw a ball to their teamate? Thus, computers don't just allow for friends-making and learning interesting facts, they also teach much needed hand-eye coordination. In conclusion, computers definately have a positive effect towards humans. They are very, very, very necessary in one's @CAPS8. Computers allow people to meet new friends,they give people the ability to learn about all different cultures and topics, and they teach people vital hand-eye coordination.

9443,1,"Have you ever really noticed how much time you spend on your computer? All of that time you are on the computer you can be exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Sure, @CAPS4 teaches you hand-eye cordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and people, and allows people to talk online with other people, but this does not help with socializing skills, being out in the environment and the money issue paying for online and electricity every year. I do not think people should spend as much time on the computer. First of all, I don't think people should spend as much time on the computer because @CAPS4 does not help their solcializing skills. Therefor, @CAPS1 people wanted to be friends with someone but they could only talk to them on the internet. This would mean that their relationship wouldn't work out because they don't know what the look like, their personality, and maybe that internet buddy is a boring person. Also, @CAPS1 you were ""addicted"" to these internet sights, you could possibly miss important events in your life that involved in interacting with a friend or family members. Another way @CAPS4 @MONTH1 affect solicialicing skills is by not being around people to talk to or hang out with. You would be locked up in your computer space and not talking to anyone. Most in person socializing skills are needed in life to enjoy things and interact better. Secondly, I don't believe that people should send so much time on his/her computer because they need to be enjoying the environment and outside. This is so because without exercise from being outdoor outside you can easily gain weight by sitting in a chair eating snacks throughout the day. Also, not being able to go outside is bad for your body to not get sunlight and fresh air. lastly, @CAPS4 shows that @PERCENT1 of people who don't get exercise and stay indoors often get depressed. This is why too much time on the computer can be bad for you, @CAPS2, @CAPS1 you spended time every single day on the computer far more than @NUM1 hours, your electricity bill would increase. @CAPS1 your family was struggling with money, especially during these times, money to pay the bills would be very hard. Secondly, since their are more than @NUM2 bill to cover up with money, @CAPS4 would be god not to use @CAPS4 a lot throughout the day. An opinion was stated in the newspaper by a citezen that he said, ""too much time using computer or any other electronic device is not only bad for you, but horrible for the money problems. This occurs to me and hopefully to you that you should not use the computer as much.

9447,1,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are beneficial in various ways. They help with hand-eye coordination, which is very useful. It also can help people interact with others around the world. Not to mention all of the great resources it has! Computers have many great characteristics. First of all, computers teach people hand-eye coordination! For instance, people have to move the mouse to move the pointer on the computer. It is very useful. It is used in sports. For example, in baseball you need to see the ball and swing the bat to hit write. It is also used to writing. To write, the pencil has to be in the space needed to write. So needless to say, hand-eye coordination is important. Some computers have software that allows the world. This is greatly beneficial in many ways. To start, people can use videochat websites to talk with people living in iother countries. This helps people communicate and become social. Being social is neccessity because it is important to let other know how you are and be able to help you. People are also available to learn other culture online. For example, people make website about cultures so people don't criticize other enthinicities for the way they do things. This can stop racism and let people feel better about themselves. Another thing that computers are good for is finding information. For instance, on the internet there are search engines. So people can type what they're looking for and find it! Some search engines are @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1, or @ORGANIZATION2! Computers can be used for educational purpose too! They can help get information for projects, jobs, and even just additional infomation. In the end, computers are very useful. They can help people learn hand-eye coordination, talk to each other from different parts of the world, and they're excellent resources. Even though they can be over used, they are really very important in life today.",,,,1914,30,322,512,10.7333333333,317,0.11,1,153,0,82,75,35,18,8,36,0,0,0,0,1
9445,1,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you relize how much compters play a role in the world these days? Alot! You @MONTH1 think they are taking over our llives and are becoming bad but I along with many others think differently. For one, they allow communication for those around the world with internet access. Also they give off any kind of info you need it can help you learn almost anything. Finally, they can be a big help if you are bored, you can play games on it and it even helps with your hand-eye coordination. You @MONTH1 here people saying they are bad to be an and are nothing but trouble but they really aren't, in fact in a recent poll @NUM1 out of @NUM2 adults around the world use a computer everyday whether its in their job ar at home. I mean come on they give us all kinds of information we need like weather, modern day news, history, math, science, reading, writting its all stuff we need that sometimes we can't find anywhere else. So if you think about it @CAPS2 computers would everyone in the world know as much as they @CAPS1? Not only does computers help us by teaching us or informing us about things but its a great source for socializing with people pretty much anywhere. Just the other day I was able to get in touch with my friend that move all the way to texas, but not only did I get to type to him I actually got to see his face by using a webcam. Webcams are compadible with almost all the computers they are producing now and trust me they are a lot of fun and a great way to stay intouch. But even if you don't have a webcam there are many socializing programs run now a days on these computers, And if anyone trys to tell you they keep you from interacting you can relize thats not true and that you are having fun interacting with freinds and family online. Speaking of fun you can even download or buy games to play on your computer and back to the interacting you can even play against friends and family on it online! The have racing, fighting, war, word, board games, pretty much any kind of game you could think of out there right out in fron of your eyes. You and your freinds will have a blast on these! If you think about it there is probably I badthing about computers for every @NUM3! nothing is perfect, but this invention was pretty close. This is a great feature in everyones life doing things from helping people learn and understand. Things to helping interact to even having fun! @NUM4 of people from @ORGANIZATION2's recent poll said the world would not be as powerful or amazing @CAPS2 computers.

I only say that because of all the time spent on desktops and laptops the influence of the computer world, and the lack of family take computers are creating. As a responsible adult, I'm sure you've noticed the time spent online by today's youth. Like everyone else, I'm sure you're worried this long time in the digital world is harmful to real world situations. For example @PERSON1, studies common family's computer usage.

""@CAPS5 I have to go to @DATE1 school because of faulty facts. ""But @CAPS3 @CAPS4 is not the only victim. Once, when I was eight, I read online that some squirrels can breathe underwater.

Computers also benefit society by serving @CAPS1 @CAPS4 resource for children in the field of education, and they serve @CAPS1 a great way to communicate with other people! Computers can benefit society because since we're in the @DATE1, and technology is advancing, then that means more jobs are adapting to computer usage! For example, I remember one time when my multi-media teacher proclaimed that, ""@CAPS2's really excellent that this generation of students is experimenting with @CAPS3, because and hospitals are using them!"" @CAPS4 example of this is, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of students who have an early learning of computer will have a better job when they get older when compared to to who didnt have an early learning or computer,"" who more than @PERCENT2 fell ! Furthermore, the next reason why computers benefit society is because they ! For example, websites like starfall, @CAPS5, or even disney channel to increase their learning by @PERCENT3! Not only that but middle school students can complete school projects like written assignments or even book projects! In fact, I even remember my teacher giving my @PERCENT5 of bonus points because my book project was typed! The last reason computers can benefit society is because they serve @CAPS1 a great way to communicate with family and friends at home but what if they live on @CAPS4 continent? Then what are you going to do? If you call them you raise your phone bill by @PERCENT4, and who wants to do that? For example, my mom's friend's family is in @LOCATION1 and instead of calling them she emails them with her computer because @CAPS2's free, and who doesnt like free communicating? In conclusion, yes I understand that some people spend too much time on computers, and need exercise, which is good once in a while, but do you want to fall behind on their job because they didnt get experience with computer usage? Don't you want students to increase their learning by @PERCENT3 throug @CAPS4 resource? And don't you want free communicating? So know you are and see the imperative side of computer usage with the terrific affable disposition, like I know you have so now is the time to decide!",,,,2697,20,453,714,22.65,443,4.79,1,204,0,149,83,27,23,20,67,0,0,0,1,1

Well the health @ORGANIZATION1 found that @PERCENT1 of people waste valuable time on the computer. The issue to grapple with is, do computers have a good effect on people. I strongly believe that computers have negative effects on people. The reason I feel this way is because many people misuse computers. Also it is unhealthy for people that overuse it. Another reason is people won't gain social skills. Certainly, many people play games on their computers. This wasn't the reason for them, however, the computer was made to share information. The @CAPS2, (@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @ORGANIZATION1) found that @PERCENT2 persent of people play games on their compoter. This @CAPS6 that a lot of people misuse the computer. Bob @CAPS5 a computer maker says, ""I would play games all the time. I never even new how much I could of learned on the computer."" This defiantly @CAPS6 how unaware people are of what the computer can do. Of course, you can agree that using the computer too much can be unhealthy. well I remember I use to use the computer all the time to play games search the web and other stuff. I never had time to go out and play. Surely, I wouldn't be in good shape with no exercise. Have you @CAPS1 noticed that you spend a lot of time on the computer? Have you been up by how much fun it is? Have you not gone outside in days? Well, this is very unhealthy and @CAPS9 americans do just this. They don't get any excercise wasting time on the computer. It is certain that many people rather play on the computer than with their friends. The @CAPS7 (@ORGANIZATION1) found that @PERCENT3 of people have bad social skills. Why you ask probally since they avoid their to be on their computer. @PERSON1 @CAPS8 a former computer coder says ""@CAPS9 of my day I was coding computers and in my spare time I was on them too, I wasn't social with anyone around me.""This oviously @CAPS6 people spend too much time with their computer and not with others. Also people spend less time with their families drifting them apart. Yes, people can use the computer too find important information, but many people use computers way too longer than they need too. The @CAPS10( @ORGANIZATION2) found that people use @PERCENT1 of their free time on computers. People are wasting time they could be using to be outside with others. As you can see computers have great negative effects on people. Many people misuse their computers. It makes people be less sociable with others. Also it is unhealthy for people.

However, this is not true, and have is why. First of all, computers teach hand eye coordination in order to do something quickly. You need to click the mouse while looking at the screen and type on the keys while looking on the screen. This will allow people better reflexes and coordination while on the computer or even doing other things, like sports, hand eye coordination is a valueable thing to learn and apply well. Another great tool that computers can provide us with is research via internet, say you were doing a project an ancient @LOCATION1 and needed to find out who led the nation in @NUM1 b.c. Instead of doing to the library and finding books that half of the time do not have what you need. Just go onto the computer and type in ""leaser of @LOCATION1 @NUM1"" and you will get @NUM3 results in less than a second. You can finish the entire project, with one tool a computer. Another thing that the computer is great for is live chat and instant messaging. It is great for contact between business or also good for just socializing with freinds. It can help you get in with your done in. You share vital information with your boss, like the new time of a or where to deliver a package as opposed to somewhere else. All of this can be done in the blink of an eye. As you can see, the computer is possibly one of the most useful sevices ever made, it can help you with almost anything.

9459,1,"Dear Local Newspaper, About @PERCENT1 of people in this world are spending to much time on the computer and they all complain of vision loss. I do not think computers benefit society. People spend to much time on the computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. First, many people are spending way to much time on the computer and less time exercising. This is causing people to have vision loss and obesity by eating and not exercising. About @PERCENT2 of people are obese in this world. Spending to much time on the computer is causing kids to not be as intelligent. They are way to addicted to the computer and therefore, @CAPS1't help have time to read or study. Parents are also concerned that their kid @MONTH1 not do there homework. They will just rush right to the computer or not put any time and effort into the homework. My mom always tells me that if I have nothing to do, ""@CAPS1't go on the computer go read or exercise"". If you are ever bored get up and take the time to exercise or read. Next, people are getting limited time to be outside and enjoying the nature. The environment is really and truly amazing if you actually take the time to study it. Around us are many trees, lakes, birds and ponds. If you look into many ponds, lakes and rivers you will see that many are polluted. Another thing that is great about nature are the animals. There are many varieties of animals that you cannot miss, colorful birds, and chipmunks. The last thing that is amazing about nature is the. The grounds are all harmed with chemicals. Global warming come anytime soon if the world does not make any effort to clean it up. So if you are sitting, go make the effort to go outside and pick up any garbage there is. Finally, computers are taking away less time from interacting with family and friends. For example, children, are in the computers for many hours. If their parents come in and ask them a question, no response. At dinner kids or adults @MONTH1 be even rushed to finish their food to get back on the computer. Remember there is such thing as a phone. Kids and parents can chat with their friends or family on the phone rather that on the computer. On sundays families like to have family time. There is none if their on the computer all day, so rather than just going on the computer pick up the phone and call a friend.

Computers have got more advanced over the years, and more and more people have been using computers In modern day, most people have computers in their buses, maybe more than @NUM2 I finf no need to take and remove computer from society. I thnk this because computers allow people to learn about history around the corld allow people to communicate with friends, family or a person from a different country, and girls more and more people @CAPS2 first reason on why us shouldnt take or remove computers from society is it lets mark from about history the computers library to get information for a project about a distance county.

In the modern world of the in one country, and have family ore friends that live in countries, you usually have to pay for that call. However with the use of a computer, this method of talking to family is free and efficient and not only benefits you, but benefits your pockets. Besides if you want to just communicate with someone whose at the just find out communication they would bring up, you just have to turn on and a instint way to talk. @CAPS2 last and final reason on why computers should be kept in society is because it gives people enjoyment. On a rainy day when there is nothing to do but look outside the window and stare, you could just turn on the computer and be bored-free. The computer has billions of websited and billions of games that not only kids will enjoy but maybe adults @CAPS1 well. Also, you can watch movies and do reports on the computer. You can order things and all types of other stuff. The computer has no endings. Now you know why I think computers should be kept in society.

There would be a had time communicating for a lot of people, the is used to do homework and business and it also allow you to learn about things and places you have seen before. So, obviously computers have apositive effect on people because of the communication they allow, the help they give students and workers and lastly the knowledge they can give about pretty much anything. I know of a lot of people who have trouble commicating with family members and I see that it hurt them. Without computers these people would have even less communication with the people they can't see on a daily or even monthly basis. My friends lives in @LOCATION3 and only comes to @LOCATION2 for special occasions like holiday's and my friend doesn't have a phone so he can't call his dad to talk to him. The only communication that he has with his dad is video cahtting and without that his dad would have no part in his life. Clearly computers have a positive effect on human's when it comes to communicating, but it doesn't stop there, it also is used for kids and adults to do school more and business.

If my dad didn't have his laptop then everyday he would to you to @LOCATION1 and I probably wouldn't see him until dinner time. So, the computer has played a very positive role in my life far. I believe taht it will keep playing and important role in my life, for the rest of my life because I am going to have to be more organized and get more information which is what the computer helps you to do. Not only does the computer allow communication and work to be done, but it also gives fun facts and allow you to learn about crazy places or people. Everybody likes to do more than work on the computer, one places like @CAPS1, or @ORGANIZATION1 that allows you to learn about things you've never even heard about. Speaking of @CAPS1 it can let meet @LOCATION1 peopel or learn @LOCATION1 things about people. you already know. So it really allows you to have a big social life. A lot of people go on vactions to places they've never been before so before they go they might go to a website about that place so they can learn about the attraction and what to do when they go ther. Also, I go to sports websoyes like @ORGANIZATION3 sports or @ORGANIZATION2 to learn about all the sports news and the scores that happened in the games. It is a good reliable source that is a good way for people to know what happened if they misses a game. any data can be found if you look hand enough on the computer. So, clearly computers give a positive effect on people for the of, that they allow people to communicate when it is tough for them to see each other, gets work more for students and business people, and last but not least it is a good source of fun facts and knowledge, you might need down the road. People really enjoy computers and therefore you can see they put a positive effect on all peopel that use them, so whoever says they don't has probablly never used one.

9470,1,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I wanted to discuss the topic of computers. As you know some people believe that computers have a positive effect on people. But others believe that too many people are on computers not exercising. Now, i belive that those people care wrong. It's not the computers fault that people are on it instead of outside. So how can you passibly blame the computers or the manufactures. Their not going to let their companys go down so people can exercise more. Even if they did there's a whole lot of other things that can stop people from exercising. My reasons for choosing this side are they can help us communicate and finally it's an easier way to do things. First, I would like to talk about helping us communicate with others. Don't you think that typing a quick note to someone is much easier than writing a letter. Plus it saves paper. And now there is even ichat so you could see the person when your talking to them. Khaser, land from long island says ""I do rather type than write. I feel that it's better for my authritis and it helps me practice for my job."" @PERCENT2 of the @ORGANIZATION1 faculty say that they prefer to send someone an email than to have to send a student it to take to them. Next, I think we should discuss the location of thingsl. How many of you had a place to go but none of your friends or family knew where it was and you used mapquest? Some people say that mapquest gets you lost but their are other sites you can go to. This is a cool and calm way to find directions. All you have to do is type in the name and print your directions. @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS3 yeah, this is definitly easier than calling up all of your relatives and making yourself crazy to find directions"" @PERCENT3 of parents say this is definitly a life saver when it comes to going to new places for vacation. Lastly I would like to talk about this being an easier way to do things. Such as talk to friends. Anyone ever heard of aim or im? This is like a text message but it is much faster. As soon as you write something you get a reply. Seventh grader @PERSON2 says ""i use aim everyday I could use it whenever, like i talk to girls and sometimes my guy friends whose numbers I don't have."" @CAPS4 show that @PERCENT1 of teens from the age eleven to about @NUM1 use aim. So, in conclosion I would like to thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to read my essay.

I strongly believe that using computers benifits society because it helps us learn, lets us talk to friends, and a lot of jobs receive computer skills. Let me explain why. First of all, @CAPS2 absolutly need computers for school wether it's for typing an essay or research for our projects. Let's face it, without computers, our lives would be @NUM1 times more difficult to deal with. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homework for grades @NUM2 are disigned to be completed by using a computer? Education these days needs to be steped up, but in order to do that, computers are without a dought vital to do so. Secondly, everyone is social. Take us kids for example: @CAPS2 all have friends and talk alot on email and facebook. Without that stuff, how would @CAPS2 communicate? Using our phones while wasting money. It's also true for adults. For instance, one time, my dad had to email a spreadsheet to his boss that was ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4""! Thank god for computers considering almost everyone needs them. In fact, @PERCENT2 of working @CAPS5 use a computer everyday. Everyday!! And third, lots of people are unemployed and many are still at risk of losing their job. My point is @CAPS1 you want your job, you better start depending on your computer. Like it or not, thats the way it is and I think it is of importance people realize that. Also, did you know that each day thousands of unemployed @CAPS5 turned down because of lack of computer skills. So @CAPS1 children are going to want jobs, @CAPS2 should start using computers as often as possible. In conclusion, it's vital that @CAPS2 use computers more often. After all, @CAPS2 need them for education, socializing, and jobs.

9473,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 there has been much argueing over the topic of computers, are they good or are they bad. I personally believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are one of the necessities for us students of @CAPS2. The internet is a wonderful resource when doing a report or even homework. You can find out information quicker and easier than with a book. Like, with our youth leadership project, @CAPS3 topic is autism. I learned a bunch more about it from the internet. Now I have many great details to put into @CAPS3 paper, yet another thing typed up by a computer. Computers have helped us very much in school. Besides just helping with school computers are good for your social life too. You can talk through friends on @CAPS4 or even @CAPS5. Even this helps you in school because when I'm sick, I just go on @CAPS5 and ask @CAPS3 friends what I missed. @CAPS5 and @CAPS4 could also be bad for certain people however, because it can be some what @CAPS8, and that could deffinately waste time you could have been excercising outside. Another way it is helpful is it has helped me make plans with friends. Once @CAPS3 friends @ORGANIZATION2 and @PERSON2 asked me if I wanted to go to the mall, then I went. Without @CAPS5 I would have stayed home that day. Another helpful use for computers is just for entertainment. I have gone on gaming sites like @CAPS8 games when I was bored. There are also funny websites like @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 where you read funny stories from people. That has helped me feel better when I was upset. A final site is @CAPS11. There are certain channels I watch all the time that are somewhat like mini tv shows, @CAPS11 channels such as smash, shane @PERSON1 tv, and @CAPS12 just to name a few. You can also download music for your ipod or @NUM1 on the computer. The computer has so many ways to prose boredom. With this essay, we mentioned several uses for the computer.

9471,1,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a key ingredient in using computers. Computers are a wonderful tool as long as they are not overused or abuse. Computers are a great advance in technology that have many positive effects on people. Computers can be used to communicate, work, and for pure enjoyment. Communication has advanced so much in the past century. Computers provide superb ways to communicate in our modern world. For example, computers have communication systemds such as e-mail and social networking sites. This way of communicating is quick, easy and stress free. Sending mail can be stressful and time consuming, so having a computer eliminates those stresses. Also, teenagers love to talk with their friends and share pictures with them, and I cannot think of a better way for them to do this than through a social networking site, such as facebook. These social networking sites provide a healthy and safe way for teens to share ideas and thoughts. Finally, computers also allow for people to communicate by paying bills online. Not only is this method of bill paying quickes and easier, it also saves the environment by not wasting the paper that the bill would normally be on. Computers are great resources for work. Whether it be research for a school project or a report for your boss, computers play a huge roll in accomplishing work. Books are good sources of information, bid the are easily outdated as how events happen. However, the internet provides many sources of information that are constantly updated. Also, the internet allows you to find information on any and all subjects imaginable in one convenient place. Because of this, people do not have to search for a book on a topic. The internet provides very efficient ways to accomplish research. In addition, presentations and documents can be made perfect with the computer. For instance, you can type a document on the computer, use spell check to check it over, and have it come out perfect. Whereas without a computer, you document would most likely have more mistakes and be a lot messier. Finally, computers open up new and exciting work to present information, such as the microsoft products of powerpoint, publisher, and photo stay. Computers provide amazing sources of entertainment with the click of a mouse. Youtube, hulu, and blogs are only a few examples of the amount of entertainment sources that are found in the computer. Youtube is a very entertaining website that includes everything from music videos to people dancing. This entertainment website is a great place for people to express their individually and talents. Youtube is also great because it is free of charge. Also, on websites such a hulu, you can watch televison and movies on your computer. This is an excellent entertainment resources because it enables you to watch your favorite shows or movies no matter how far away from a t.v. you are. For example, when your children are crying during a long car drive you can simlpy put on their favorite movie on the computer and keep them satisfied. In addition, are great sources of entertainment because they allow people to see other peoples' opinions and respond with their own.

9475,1,"Dear local @CAPS1, Have you every wondered how spending to much on a computer can be a bad thing. Well, I'm were to speak on the behalf of all the people who concur with this idea. Many people are spending way to much time sitting in front of a computer screen. There are three main reasons that computers can be a bad thing. The first reason is it takes a toll on your body. The second reason is the computer exposes people to inapporiate things. last but not least, people should spend more time outdoor or exercising. Initialy, to much of one thing is bad for you. You need to a certain amount of computer time, but as soon as you spend to much time on the computer it becomes bad for you. If you spend to much time on a computer you can damage you eye sight. Also many people forget to do daily things if they are spending to much time on a computer . for example many people forget to eat. Computers also effect your sleeping habits. Many people stay on to late so this effects how they sleep so as you can see, computers take a toll on your body. Secondly people should be spending more time outdoor or exercising. If people decide to spend more time running or playing sports rather that sitting in front of a screen for hours on a time they can be in better shape. Also will be open to more things if they are out side insted of inside. When your outside you can get fresh air. fresh air allows you brain to work better, can a computer do that? The last and most important reason is, on a computer you are exposed to many inapproriate things. Many teen are using language, better know are curse words. Also people are exposed to pornography and other things like sexing. lastly there is a lot of cyber bullying going on these days. cyber bullying can hurt many people phycologicly. I just explained why to much time on a computer can be bad for you. It is your choice to listen. The three main reasons are spending to much time can take a toll on your body. Second reason is more exercise and the last reason is people are exposed to things.

Also, most research nowadays has taken place using the encyclopedias and blogs on our computers! Finally, excercise, along with enjoying yourself, are very common amongst the computer world. If you haven't realized it by now, I think that computers have changed the human society for the better. We knew about @LOCATION2 at the time that the earthquake occured.

When the Los Angeles attempted tie to the mooring mast in @DATE1 the winds were too great, and the dirigible was pushed away. The problem with the building's structure is that when the dirigible ties in it will cause too much stress to the building.

The two ships that ever tried docking onto the building were both failures, neither of them able to tie onto the dock. The biggest trouble for the creation of the mooring mast was how dangerous accidents would have been.

Being in a highly constructed area there was very little ""suitable landing area"" for such big dirigibles to land. Another construction issue was that the building's frame and foundation was already built, but wasn't constructed with the idea that dirigibles were going to be docking on it, so they had to go back and reinforce the steel frame to hold under the new stress that would occur. Lingering in the back of their minds was the fact that other countrie's blimps used hydrogen and helium, very highly flammable gases. Especially after seeing the Hindenburg flash up, they knew a accident like that over an urban area would be a disaster. The strong wind currents fluttering in different directions would also make it harder for blimps to dock steady. With new flying codes about not being able to fly low over highly populated areas, came one of the last blows to shoot down this idea.

If the hydrogen were to ignite it would burn over the populated city of New York. Also if a dirigible were to dock on a windy day the back would swivel. The only resolution to the swiveling back would be to put weight on the back of the dirigible but if the rope were to snap the weight would be a danger to the people below.

The safety of the pedestrians down at the streets of New York City was a crucial aspect. Nature did not help either, because it is so unpredictable. After many stories about the unsafety of dirigibles, they decided that having one suspended from a very tall building, over pedestrians, was not safe at all. The builders only realized this problem later, which should have been apparent before they even began constructing. They came to a conclusion that having a dirigible ""dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe"" (Lsted @NUM1). Safety is the most important aspect when constructing a building, therefore sometimes construction has to be stopped in order to create safety for the people. But safety was not the only obstacle faced by these builders, nature, which is unpredictable played a great part in this. When constructing a building, the weather has to be taken into consideration. In this case the major problem was the wind. The top of the building the winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (Lsted @NUM1).

One reason why dirigibles wouldn't be able to dock at the top of the building was due to the high winds and the length of the airship. Normally when a dirigibles lands, it's an open landing field and they could be weighed down in back with lead weights.

After the scare of the Hindenburg incident, people began to realise that dirigible accidents could very easily occurr. The government was concerned with the @DATE1 foot long dirigible crashing down upon the crowded and busy New York City. Also, in concern for the safety of the people, there were laws of the minimum altitude that airships could fly. If this mooring tower were to be build, this law would be broken and the safety of thousands of people would be compromised, making this a nearly impossible project.Lastly, nature was a major obstacle to hault the building process.

Even before they started to construct the mast they should have viewed the laws.During the construction was the time with the most problems. First off they could not just simply drop the mast on top of the building. The mast had to be built with a steel frame to. Also before they could do that they had to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building. Mostly because they realized that tieing dirigibles to the mast would eventually cause stress on the frame of the Building due to the dirigibles moving around cause of the harsh wind.

The first obstacle to hurl over for the constructers of this project that was deemed to redefine the age of transportation was to find a way to build a skyscrapper that could support the weight and pull of a thousand-foot dirigible tied to the mast atop the building without hulling the building over. The engineers of this project, realizing that the pressure from the immense dirigible would be spanned out throughout the building, thus decided to make improvements to the building's steel frame itself to strengthen it for its new docking purpose. Another challenge builders had to face was to plot efficient space to accommodate all the needs of air travel, like areas for baggage, tickets, observation, and boarding. The builders swiftly conquered this work by building one-hundred-two floors equipped with elevators to bring people quickly to their luggage and an extra observation area to effectively double boarding space for passengers.

Another way on how the author might have closed it on the paragraph would be because it could be like a sign from above like when this happens then you will be married and sure enough when that thing happens you are getting warned so maybe it was a sign from @CAPS1 or another world saying that Òwhen the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test againÓ So in conclusion I think that the hibiscus was a symbol of her life saying that sheÕs out of place but can continue living like the hibiscus and also it could be a symbol from @CAPS1.,,,,1262,5,239,325,47.8,229,14.54,0,117,0,62,39,8,11,10,42,0,0,0,0,0

The tone that the author creates by this last sentence is of @CAPS1 and a way of adjusting to a new life. Throughout the story, the girl Saeng has been defined by nostalgia, her longing for the past. This is especially shown when the flowers she had once seen in Vietnam were in the florist shop: ÒSaeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral"". She remembered finding the petals of this plant in her well. When describing SaengÕs nostalgia, the author had used imagery words to draw the reader in and almost becore Saeng.
